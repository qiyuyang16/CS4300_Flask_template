At  8:10  a.m.,  Myronville  police  officer  Will \nSimpson pulled Trish over (Officer Simpson had to use his siren to catch Trish\u2019s attention, because Trish \ncould not see clearly out the ice-covered back window). Trish had to open her driver side door to speak \nwith Officer Simpson, because the \u00bd-inch of ice on the Landcruiser\u2019s driver side window prevented Trish \nfrom rolling the window down. Officer Simpson issued Trish a ticket for violating Nirvana traffic laws which \nrequire drivers to have an \u201cunobstructed view\u201d of the road.  Trish was not pleased and refused to take \nthe ticket when Officer Simpson tried to hand the ticket to her. Instead, Trish proceeded to yell at and \nberate Officer Simpson.  A large  crowd gathered  around  Trish\u2019s stopped Landcruiser,  Trish, and Officer \nSimpson,  attracted  by  all  the  noise  Trish  was making.  Invigorated  by  the  crowd,  Trish  yelled, \u201cI\u2019m  not \ntaking any ticket from this government bully! Let him know how we feel about tickets!\u201d The crowd roared \nits approval. Trish yelled, \u201cJoin me! Simpson is a snake! Snakes get stomped!\u201d The crowd immediately \njoined Trish in the chant: \u201cSimpson is a snake! Snakes get stomped!\u201d Neither Trish nor anyone in the crowd \nphysically  touched  Officer  Simpson.  After  about  15  minutes,  with  Trish  still  yelling  insults  at  Officer \nSimpson and gleefully leading the crowd in the \u201csnake\u201d chant, Officer Simpson issued Trish a second ticket, \nthis one for \u201charassment of a law enforcement officer.\u201d  Officer Simpson threw both tickets through the \nLandcruiser\u2019s open driver side door, got into his police car, and drove away."
