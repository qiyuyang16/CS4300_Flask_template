In Chapter 3, the NDs have been categorized into divisions (Diagnostic Divisions: Nursing Diagnoses Organized According to a Nursing Focus, Section 2) and an assessment tool designed to assist the nurse to identify appropriate NDs as the data are collected. Nurses may feel at risk in committing themselves to documenting a nursing diagnosis for fear they might be wrong. However, unlike medical diagnoses, NDs can change as the client progresses through various stages of illness/maladaptation to resolution of the condition/situation.\n\n\n5,   cosine score: 0.41722324588943355,   page: 26\nTable 2–1.

To facilitate the steps of assessment and diagnosis in the nursing process, an assessment tool (Assessment Tools for Choosing Nursing Diagnoses, Section 1) has been constructed using a nursing focus instead of the medical approach of “review of systems.” This has the advantage of identifying and validating nursing diagnoses (NDs) as opposed to medical diagnoses.\n\n\n8,   cosine score: 0.3843657116607863,   page: 30\nTo achieve this nursing focus, we have grouped the NANDA International (formerly the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) NDs into related categories titled Diagnostic Divisions (Section 2), which reflect a blending of theories, primarily Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and a self-care philosophy. These divisions serve as the framework or outline for data collection/clustering that focuses attention on the nurse’s phenomena of concern—the human responses to actual and potential health problems—and directs the nurse to the most likely corresponding NDs.\n\n\n9,   cosine score: 0.3051448894900202,   page: 48\nDelivery history: Year: Length of gestation: Type of delivery: Born (alive or dead): Weight:\n\n\n10,   cosine score: 0.2783198764143709,   page: 31\nSection 3, “Client Situation and Prototype Plan of Care,” contains a sample plan of care formulated on data collected in the nursing model assessment tool. Individualized client diagnostic statements and desired client outcomes (with timelines added to reflect anticipated length of stay and individual client/nurse expectations) have been identified. Interventions have been chosen based on concerns/needs identified by the client and nurse during data collection, as well as by physician orders.\n\n\n"
