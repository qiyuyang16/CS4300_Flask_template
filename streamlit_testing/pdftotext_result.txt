                                     How to Use the
                       Nurse’s Pocket Guide
The American Nurses Association (ANA) Social Policy
Statement of 1980 was the first to define nursing as the diagno-
sis and treatment of human responses to actual and potential
health problems. This definition, when combined with the ANA
Standards of Practice, has provided impetus and support for the
use of nursing diagnosis. Defining nursing and its effect on
client care supports the growing awareness that nursing care is
a key factor in client survival and in the maintenance, rehabili-
tative, and preventive aspects of healthcare. Changes and new
developments in healthcare delivery in the last decade have
given rise to the need for a common framework of communica-
tion to ensure continuity of care for the client moving between
multiple healthcare settings and providers. Evaluation and
documentation of care are important parts of this process.
   This book is designed to aid the practitioner and student
nurse in identifying interventions commonly associated with
specific nursing diagnoses as proposed by NANDA Inter-
national (formerly the North American Nursing Diagnosis
Association). These interventions are the activities needed to
implement and document care provided to the individual
client and can be used in varied settings from acute to commu-
nity/home care.
   Chapters 1 and 2 present brief discussions of the nursing
process, data collection, and care plan construction. Chapter 3
contains the Diagnostic Divisions, Assessment Tool, a sample
plan of care, and corresponding documentation/charting exam-
ples. For more in-depth information and inclusive plans of care
related to specific medical/psychiatric conditions (with ration-
ale and the application of the diagnoses), the nurse is referred
to the larger works, all published by the F.A. Davis Company:
Nursing Care Plans: Guidelines for Planning and Documenting
Patient Care, ed. 6 (Doenges, Moorhouse, Geissler-Murr, 2002);
Psychiatric Care Plans: Guidelines for Planning and Documenting
Client Care, ed. 3 (Doenges, Townsend, Moorhouse, 1998); and
Maternal/Newborn Plans of Care: Guidelines for Planning and
Documenting Client Care, ed. 3 (Doenges, Moorhouse, 1999).
   Nursing diagnoses are listed alphabetically in Chapter 4 for
ease of reference and include the diagnoses accepted for use by
                                                                  xiii


   NANDA through 2003. Each approved diagnosis includes its
   definition and information divided into the NANDA categories
   of Related or Risk Factors and Defining Characteristics.
   Related/Risk Factors information reflects causative or
   contributing factors that can be useful for determining whether
   the diagnosis is applicable to a particular client. Defining
   Characteristics (signs and symptoms or cues) are listed as
   subjective and/or objective and are used to confirm actual diag-
   noses, aid in formulating outcomes, and provide additional data
   for choosing appropriate interventions. The authors have not
   deleted or altered NANDA’s listings; however, on occasion, they
   have added to their definitions and suggested additional criteria
   to provide clarification and direction. These additions are
   denoted with brackets [ ].
      With the development and acceptance of Taxonomy II
   following the biennial conference in 2000, significant changes
   were made to better reflect the content of the diagnoses within
   the taxonomy. It is designed to reduce miscalculations, errors,
   and redundancies. The framework has been changed from the
   Human Response Patterns and is organized in Domains only
   and Classes, with 13 domains, 105 classes, and 167 diagnoses.
   Although clinicians will use the actual diagnoses, understanding
   the taxonomic structure will help the nurse to find the desired
   information quickly. Taxonomy II is designed to be multiaxial
   with 7 axes (see Appendix 2). An axis is defined as a dimension
   of the human response that is considered in the diagnostic
   process. Sometimes an axis may be included in the diagnostic
   concept, such as ineffective community coping in which the
   unit of care (e.g., community) is named. Some are implicit, such
   as activity intolerance in which the individual is the unit of care.
   Sometimes an axis may not be pertinent to a particular diagno-
   sis and will not be a part of the nursing diagnosis label or code.
   For example, the time axis may not be relevant to each diagnos-
   tic situation. The Taxonomic Domain and Class are noted under
   each nursing diagnosis heading. An Axis 6 descriptor is included
   in each nursing diagnosis label.
      The ANA, in conjunction with NANDA, proposed that
   specific nursing diagnoses currently approved and structured
   according to Taxonomy I Revised be included in the Inter-
   national Classification of Diseases (ICD) within the section
   “Family of Health-Related Classifications.” While the World
   Health Organization did not accept this initial proposal because
   of lack of documentation of the usefulness of nursing diagnoses
   at the international level, the NANDA list has been accepted by
   SNOMED (Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine) for inclu-
   sion in its international coding system and is included in the
   Unified Medical Language System of the National Library of
iv HOW TO USE THE NURSE’S POCKET GUIDE


Medicine. Today, researchers from around the world are validat-
ing nursing diagnoses in support for resubmission and accep-
tance in future additions of ICD.
   The authors have chosen to categorize the list of nursing
diagnoses approved for clinical use and testing into Diagnostic
Divisions, which is the framework for an assessment tool
(Chapter 3) designed to assist the nurse to readily identify an
appropriate nursing diagnosis from data collected during the
assessment process. The Diagnostic Division label is included
following the Taxonomic label under each nursing diagnosis
heading.
   Desired Outcomes/Evaluation Criteria are identified to assist
the nurse in formulating individual client outcomes and to
support the evaluation process.
   Interventions in this pocket guide are primarily directed to
adult care settings (although general age span considerations
are included) and are listed according to nursing priorities.
Some interventions require collaborative or interdependent
orders (e.g., medical, psychiatric), and the nurse will need to
determine when this is necessary and take the appropriate
action. Although all defining characteristics are listed, interven-
tions that address specialty areas outside the scope of this book
are not routinely presented (e.g., obstetrics/gynecology/pedi-
atrics) except for diagnoses that are infancy-oriented, such as
Breastfeeding, ineffective; Infant Behavior, disorganized; and
Parent/Infant/Child Attachment, risk for impaired. For exam-
ple, when addressing deficient Fluid Volume, isotonic (hemor-
rhage), the nurse is directed to stop blood loss; however, specific
direction to perform fundal massage is not listed.
   The inclusion of Documentation Focus suggestions is to
remind the nurse of the importance and necessity of recording
the steps of the nursing process.
   Finally, in recognition of the ongoing work of numerous
researchers over the past 15 years, the authors have referenced
the Nursing Interventions and Outcomes labels developed by
the Iowa Intervention Projects (Bulechek & McCloskey;
Johnson, Mass, & Moorhead). These groups have been classify-
ing nursing interventions and outcomes to predict resource
requirements and measure outcomes, thereby meeting the
needs of a standardized language that can be coded for
computer and reimbursement purposes. As an introduction to
this work in progress, sample NIC and NOC labels have been
included under the heading Sample Nursing Interventions &
Outcomes Classifications at the conclusion of each nursing
diagnosis section. The reader is referred to the various publica-
tions by Joanne C. McCloskey and Marion Johnson for more in-
depth information.

      Chapter 5 presents over 400 disorders/health conditions
   reflecting all specialty areas, with associated nursing diagnoses
   written as client diagnostic statements that include the “related
   to” and “evidenced by” components. This section will facilitate
   and help validate the assessment and problem/need identifica-
   tion steps of the nursing process.
      As noted, with few exceptions, we have presented NANDA’s
   recommendations as formulated. We support the belief that
   practicing nurses and researchers need to study, use, and evalu-
   ate the diagnoses as presented. Nurses can be creative as they use
   the standardized language, redefining and sharing information
   as the diagnoses are used with individual patients. As new nurs-
   ing diagnoses are developed, it is important that the data they
   encompass are added to the current database. As part of the
   process by clinicians, educators, and researchers across practice
   specialties and academic settings to define, test, and refine nurs-
   ing diagnosis, nurses are encouraged to share insights and ideas

vi HOW TO USE THE NURSE’S POCKET GUIDE


                                            CHAPTER 1
                  The Nursing Process
   Many years ago, the nursing profession identified a problem-
solving process that “combines the most desirable elements of
the art of nursing with the most relevant elements of systems
theory, using the scientific method” (Shore, 1988). The term
nursing process was introduced in the 1950s and has gained
national acceptance as the basis for providing effective nursing
care. It is now included in the conceptual framework of all nurs-
ing curricula and is accepted in the legal definition of nursing in
the nurse practice acts of most states. This nursing process is
central to nursing actions in any setting, because it is an efficient
method of organizing thought processes for clinical decision
making and problem solving.
   Use of the nursing process requires the skills of (1) assess-
ment (systematic collection of data relating to clients and their
needs), (2) problem/need identification (analysis of data), (3)
planning (setting goals, choice of solutions), (4) implementa-
tion (putting the plan into action), and (5) evaluation (assess-
ing the effectiveness of the plan and changing the plan as
indicated by the current needs). Although these skills are
presented as separate, individual activities, they are interrelated
and form a continuous circle of thought and action.
   To use this process, the nurse must demonstrate fundamental
abilities of knowledge, creativity, adaptability, commitment,
trust, and leadership. In addition, intelligence and interpersonal
and technical skills are important. Because decision making is
crucial to each step of the process, the following assumptions
are important for the nurse to consider:
   • The client is a human being who has worth and dignity.
   • There are basic human needs that must be met, and when
     they are not, problems arise, requiring interventions by
     another person until and if the individual can resume
     responsibility for self.
   • The client has a right to quality health and nursing care
     delivered with interest, compassion, competence, and a
     focus on wellness and prevention of illness.
   • The therapeutic nurse-client relationship is important in
     this process.
   Nurses have struggled for years to define nursing by identi-
fying the parameters of nursing with the goal of attaining
                                                                      1


professional status. To this end, nurses meet, discuss, and
conduct research (in both the national and international
arenas) to identify and label client problems and responses that
fall within the scope of nursing practice. Changes in healthcare
delivery and reimbursement methods, the advent of health
maintenance organizations (HMOs), and alternative healthcare
settings (home health, extended-care facilities, and the like)
continue to increase the need for a commonality of communi-
cation to ensure continuity of care for the client who moves
from one setting/area to another. Evaluation and improvement
of provided services are an important part of this process, and
both providers and users of care benefit from accurate docu-
mentation of the care provided and the client’s response.
   The use of nursing diagnosis (ND) provides nurses with a
common language for identifying client needs, aids in the
choice of nursing interventions, and provides guidance for eval-
uation. It promotes improved communication among nurses,
shifts, units, other healthcare providers, and alternative care
settings. This language further provides a base for clinicians,
educators, and researchers to document, validate, and/or alter
the process. The American Nurses Association (ANA) Social
Policy Statements (1980/1995) and the ANA Standards of
Practice (1973/1991) have provided impetus and support for
the use of nursing diagnosis in the practice setting.
   Currently, there are differing definitions of nursing diagno-
sis. NANDA International (formerly The North American
Nursing Diagnosis Association) has accepted the following
definition:
      Nursing diagnosis is a clinical judgment about individ-
   ual, family, or community responses to actual and poten-
   tial health problems/life processes. Nursing diagnoses
   provide the basis for selection of nursing interventions to
   achieve outcomes for which the nurse is accountable.
   Although it continues to evolve, the current NANDA list
provides diagnostic labels and information for appropriate use.
Nurses need to become familiar with the parameters of the
diagnoses, identifying strengths and weaknesses, thus promot-
ing research and further development. Although nursing prac-
tice is more than nursing diagnosis, the use of standardized
nursing language can help to define and to refine the profession.
Also, NDs can be used within many existing conceptual frame-
works because they are a generic approach adaptable to all.
   Whereas nursing actions were once based on variables such as
signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests, and medical diagnoses,
NDs are a uniform way of identifying, focusing on, and deal-
ing with specific client problems/needs. The accurate nursing
NURSE’S POCKET GUIDE


diagnosis of a client need can set a standard for nursing
practice, thus leading to improved care delivery.
   Nursing and medicine are interrelated and have implications
for each other. This interrelationship includes the exchange of
data, the sharing of ideas/thinking, and the development of
plans of care that include all data pertinent to the individual
client as well as the family/significant other(s) (SO[s]). This
relationship also extends to all disciplines that have contact with
the individual/family. Although nurses work within the medical
and psychosocial domains, nursing’s phenomena of concern
are the patterns of human response, not disease processes.
Therefore, nursing diagnoses usually do not parallel or mimic
medical/psychiatric diagnoses but do involve independent
nursing activities as well as collaborative roles and actions.
Thus, the written plan of care contains more than actions
initiated by medical orders. It contains a combination of the
orders and plans of care of all involved disciplines. The nurse
is responsible for seeing that these different activities are pulled
together into a functional plan to provide holistic care for the
individual/family.
Summary
   In using ND as an integral part of the nursing process, the
nursing profession has identified a body of knowledge that
contributes to the prevention of illness as well as to the mainte-
nance and/or restoration of health (or relief of pain and
discomfort when a return to health is not possible). Because the
nursing process is the basis of all nursing actions, it is the
essence of nursing. The process is flexible and yet sufficiently
structured so as to provide the base for nursing actions. It can
be applied in any healthcare or educational setting, in any theo-
retical or conceptual framework, and within the context of any
nursing philosophy.
   Subsequent chapters help the nurse apply the nursing process
to become more familiar with the current NANDA-approved
list of NDs, their definitions, related/risk factors (etiology), and
defining characteristics. Coupled with desired outcomes and the
most commonly used interventions, the nurse can write, imple-
ment, and document an individualized plan of care.

CHAPTER 2
Application of
the Nursing Process
   Because of their hectic schedules, many nurses believe that
time spent writing plans of care is time taken away from client
care. Plans of care have been viewed as “busy work” to satisfy
accreditation requirements or the whims of supervisors. In real-
ity, however, quality client care must be planned and coordi-
nated. Properly written and used plans of care can provide
direction and continuity of care by facilitating communication
among nurses and other caregivers. They also provide guide-
lines for documentation and a tool for evaluating the care
provided.
   The components of a plan of care are based on the nursing
process. Creating a plan of care begins with the collection of
data (assessment). The client database consists of subjective and
objective information encompassing the various concerns
reflected in the current NANDA International (formerly the
North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) list of nursing
diagnoses (NDs) (Table 2–1). Subjective data are those that are
reported by the client (and SOs) in the individual’s own words.
This information includes the individual’s perceptions and
what he or she wants to share. It is important to accept what is
reported because the client is the “expert” in this area. Objective
data are those that are observed or described (quantitatively or
qualitatively) and include diagnostic testing and physical exam-
ination findings. Analysis of the collected data leads to the iden-
tification of problems or areas of concern/need. These problems
or needs are expressed as NDs.
   A nursing diagnosis is a decision about a need/problem that
requires nursing intervention and management. The need may
be anything that interferes with the quality of life the client is
used to and/or desires. It includes concerns of the client, SOs,
and/or nurse. The ND focuses attention on a physical or behav-
ioral response, either a current need or a problem at risk for
developing. When the ND label is combined with the individ-
ual’s specific related/risk factors and defining characteristics (as
appropriate), a client diagnostic statement is created. This
provides direction for nursing care, and its affective tone can

  shape expectations of the client’s response and/or influence the
  nurse’s behavior toward the client.
     The key to accurate diagnosis is collection and analysis of
  data. In Chapter 3, the NDs have been categorized into divisions
  (Diagnostic Divisions: Nursing Diagnoses Organized According
  to a Nursing Focus, Section 2) and an assessment tool designed
  to assist the nurse to identify appropriate NDs as the data are
  collected. Nurses may feel at risk in committing themselves to
  documenting a nursing diagnosis for fear they might be wrong.
  However, unlike medical diagnoses, NDs can change as the
  client progresses through various stages of illness/maladapta-
  tion to resolution of the condition/situation.
     Desired outcomes are formulated to give direction to, as well
  as to evaluate, the care provided. These outcomes emerge from
  the diagnostic statement and are what the client hopes to
  achieve. They serve as the guidelines to evaluate progress toward
  resolution of needs/problems, providing impetus for revising
  the plan as appropriate. In this book, outcomes are stated in
  general terms to permit the practitioner to individualize them
  by adding timelines and other data according to specific client
  circumstances. Outcome terminology needs to be concise, real-
  istic, measurable, and stated in words the client can understand.
  Beginning the outcome statement with an action verb provides
  measurable direction, for example, “Verbalizes relationship
  between diabetes mellitus and circulatory changes in feet within
  2 days” or “Correctly performs procedure of home glucose
  monitoring within 48 hours.”
     Interventions are the action steps taken to achieve desired
  outcomes and, because they are communicated to others, they
  must be clearly stated. A solid nursing knowledge base is vital to
  this process because the rationale for interventions needs to be
  sound and feasible with the intention of providing effective
  individualized care. The actions may be independent or collab-
  orative and may encompass specific orders from nursing, medi-
  cine, and other disciplines. Written interventions that guide
  ongoing client care need to be dated and signed. To facilitate the
  planning process, specific nursing priorities have been identi-
  fied in this text to provide a general ranking of interventions.
  This ranking would be altered according to individual client
  situations. The seasoned practitioner may choose to use these as
  broad-based interventions. The student or beginning practi-
  tioner may need to develop a more detailed plan of care by
  including the appropriate interventions listed under each nurs-
  ing priority. Finally, as each client usually has a perception of
  individual needs or problems he or she faces and an expectation
  of what could be done about the situation, the plan of care must
  be congruent with the client’s reality or it will fail.
0 NURSE’S POCKET GUIDE


   The plan of care documents client care in areas of accounta-
bility, quality assurance, and liability. The nurse needs to plan
care with the client, because both are accountable for that care
and for achieving the desired outcomes.
Summary
   Healthcare providers have a responsibility for planning with
the client and family for continuation of care to the eventual
outcome of an optimal state of wellness or a dignified death.
Planning, setting goals, and choosing appropriate interventions
are essential to the construction of a plan of care as well as to
delivery of quality nursing care. These nursing activities
comprise the planning phase of the nursing process and are
documented in the plan of care for a particular client. As a part
of the client’s permanent record, the plan of care not only
provides a means for the nurse who is actively caring for the
client to be aware of the client’s needs (NDs), goals, and actions
to be taken, but it also substantiates the care provided for review
by third-party payors and accreditation agencies, while meeting
legal requirements.

  CHAPTER 3
  Putting Theory into
  Practice: Sample
  Assessment Tools, Plan of
  Care, and Documentation
     The client assessment is the foundation on which identifica-
  tion of individual needs, responses, and problems is based. To
  facilitate the steps of assessment and diagnosis in the nursing
  process, an assessment tool (Assessment Tools for Choosing
  Nursing Diagnoses, Section 1) has been constructed using a
  nursing focus instead of the medical approach of “review of
  systems.” This has the advantage of identifying and validating
  nursing diagnoses (NDs) as opposed to medical diagnoses.
     To achieve this nursing focus, we have grouped the NANDA
  International (formerly the North American Nursing Diagno-
  sis Association) NDs into related categories titled Diagnostic
  Divisions (Section 2), which reflect a blending of theories,
  primarily Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and a self-care philoso-
  phy. These divisions serve as the framework or outline for data
  collection/clustering that focuses attention on the nurse’s
  phenomena of concern—the human responses to actual and
  potential health problems—and directs the nurse to the most
  likely corresponding NDs.
     Because the divisions are based on human responses and
  needs and not specific “systems,” information may be recorded
  in more than one area. For this reason, the nurse is encouraged
  to keep an open mind, to pursue all leads, and to collect as much
  data as possible before choosing the ND label that best reflects
  the client’s situation. For example, when the nurse identifies the
  cue of restlessness in a client, the nurse may infer that the client
  is anxious, assuming that the restlessness is psychologically
  based and overlooking the possibility that it is physiologically
  based.
     From the specific data recorded in the database, an individu-
  alized client diagnostic statement can be formulated using the
  problem, etiology, signs/symptoms (PES) format to accurately
  represent the client’s situation. For example, the diagnostic
2 NURSE’S POCKET GUIDE


statement may read, “deficient Knowledge regarding diabetic
care, related to misinterpretation of information and/or lack
of recall, evidenced by inaccurate follow-through of instruc-
tions and failure to recognize signs and symptoms of hyper-
glycemia.”
   Desired client outcomes are identified to facilitate choosing
appropriate interventions and to serve as evaluators of both
nursing care and client response. These outcomes also form the
framework for documentation.
   Interventions are designed to specify the action of the nurse,
the client, and/or SOs. Interventions need to promote the
client’s movement toward health/independence in addition to
achievement of physiologic stability. This requires involvement
of the client in his or her own care, including participation in
decisions about care activities and projected outcomes.
   Section 3, “Client Situation and Prototype Plan of Care,”
contains a sample plan of care formulated on data collected in
the nursing model assessment tool. Individualized client diag-
nostic statements and desired client outcomes (with timelines
added to reflect anticipated length of stay and individual
client/nurse expectations) have been identified. Interventions
have been chosen based on concerns/needs identified by the
client and nurse during data collection, as well as by physician
orders.
   Although not normally included in a written plan of care,
rationales are included in this sample for the purpose of
explaining or clarifying the choice of interventions to enhance
the nurse’s learning.
   Finally, to complete the learning experience, samples of
documentation based on the client situation are presented in
Section 4, “Documentation Techniques.” The plan of care
provides documentation of the planning process and serves as a
framework/outline for charting of administered care. The
primary nurse needs to periodically review the client’s progress
and the effectiveness of the treatment plan. Persons then are
able to read the notes and have a clear picture of what occurred
with the client in order to make appropriate judgments regard-
ing client management. The best way to ensure the clarity of
progress notes is through the use of descriptive (or observa-
tional) statements. Observations of client behavior and
response to therapy provide invaluable information. Through
this communication, it can be determined if the client’s current
desired outcomes or interventions need to be eliminated or
altered and if the development of new outcomes or interven-
tions is warranted. Progress notes are an integral component of
the overall medical record and should include all significant
events that occur in the daily life of the client. They reflect
                         PUTTING THEORY INTO PRACTICE             13


  implementation of the treatment plan and document that
  appropriate actions have been carried out, precautions taken,
  and so forth. It is important that both the implementation of
  interventions and progress toward the desired outcomes be
  documented. The notes need to be written in a clear and objec-
  tive fashion, specific as to date and time, and signed by the
  person making the entry.
     Use of clear documentation helps the nurse to individualize
  client care. Providing a picture of what has happened and is
  happening promotes continuity of care and facilitates evalua-
  tion. This reinforces each person’s accountability and responsi-
  bility for using nursing process to provide individually
  appropriate and cost-effective client care.

Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
Criteria—Client Will:
• Identify negative factors affecting activity tolerance and elim-
  inate or reduce their effects when possible.
• Use identified techniques to enhance activity tolerance.
• Participate willingly in necessary/desired activities.
• Report measurable increase in activity tolerance.
• Demonstrate a decrease in physiologic signs of intolerance
  (e.g., pulse, respirations, and blood pressure remain within
  client’s normal range).
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 1. To identify causative/precipitating
factors:
• Note presence of factors contributing to fatigue (e.g., acute or
  chronic illness, heart failure, hypothyroidism, cancer, and
  cancer therapies, etc.).
• Evaluate current limitations/degree of deficit in light of usual
  status. (Provides comparative baseline.)
• Note client reports of weakness, fatigue, pain, difficulty
  accomplishing tasks, and/or insomnia.
• Assess cardiopulmonary response to physical activity, includ-
  ing vital signs before, during, and after activity. Note progres-
  sion/accelerating degree of fatigue.
• Ascertain ability to stand and move about and degree of assis-
  tance necessary/use of equipment.
• Identify activity needs versus desires (e.g., is barely able to
  walk upstairs but would like to play racquetball).
• Assess emotional/psychologic factors affecting the current
  situation (e.g., stress and/or depression may be increasing the
  effects of an illness, or depression might be the result of
  being forced into inactivity).
• Note treatment-related factors, such as side effects/interac-
  tions of medications.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assist client to deal with contribut-
ing factors and manage activities within individual limits:
• Monitor vital/cognitive signs, watching for changes in blood
  pressure, heart and respiratory rate; note skin pallor and/or
  cyanosis, and presence of confusion.
• Adjust activities to prevent overexertion. Reduce intensity

    level or discontinue activities that cause undesired physiologic
    changes.
  • Provide/monitor response to supplemental oxygen and
    medications and changes in treatment regimen.
  • Increase exercise/activity levels gradually; teach methods to
    conserve energy, such as stopping to rest for 3 minutes during
    a 10-minute walk, sitting down instead of standing to brush
    hair.
  • Plan care with rest periods between activities to reduce
    fatigue.
  • Provide positive atmosphere, while acknowledging difficulty
    of the situation for the client. (Helps to minimize frustration,
    rechannel energy.)
  • Encourage expression of feelings contributing to/resulting
    from condition.
  • Involve client/SO(s) in planning of activities as much as
    possible.
  • Assist with activities and provide/monitor client’s use of assis-
    tive devices (crutches, walker, wheelchair, oxygen tank, etc.) to
    protect client from injury.
  • Promote comfort measures and provide for relief of pain to
    enhance ability to participate in activities. (Refer to ND Pain,
    acute or Pain, chronic.)
  • Provide referral to other disciplines as indicated (e.g.,
    exercise physiologist, psychologic counseling/therapy, occu-
    pational/physical therapists, and recreation/leisure spe-
    cialists) to develop individually appropriate therapeutic
    regimens.
  NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote wellness (Teaching/
  Discharge Considerations):
  • Plan for maximal activity within the client’s ability.
  • Review expectations of client/SO(s)/providers to establish
    individual goals. Explore conflicts/differences to reach agree-
    ment for the most effective plan.
  • Instruct client/SO(s) in monitoring response to activity and
    in recognizing signs/symptoms that indicate need to alter
    activity level.
  • Plan for progressive increase of activity level as client
    tolerates.
  • Give client information that provides evidence of daily/
    weekly progress to sustain motivation.
  • Assist client to learn and demonstrate appropriate safety
    measures to prevent injuries.
  • Provide information about the effect of lifestyle and overall
    health factors on activity tolerance (e.g., nutrition, adequate
    fluid intake, mental health status).
  • Encourage client to maintain positive attitude; suggest use of

     cancer, multiple sclerosis—MS, extensive surgical procedures]
  [Verbalized reluctance/inability to perform expected activity]
    NOTE: A risk diagnosis is not evidenced by signs and symptoms, as
    the problem has not occurred and nursing interventions are
    directed at prevention.
  Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
  Criteria––Client Will:
  • Verbalize understanding of potential loss of ability in relation
     to existing condition.
  • Participate in conditioning/rehabilitation program to en-
     hance ability to perform.
  • Identify alternative ways to maintain desired activity level
     (e.g., if weather is bad, walking in a shopping mall could be an
     option).
  • Identify conditions/symptoms that require medical reeval-
     uation.
  Actions/Interventions
  NURSING PRIORITY NO.          1. To assess factors affecting current
  situation:
  • Identify factors that could block/affect desired level of activity
     (e.g., age, arthritis, climate, or weather).
  • Note presence of medical diagnosis and/or therapeutic regi-
     men that has potential for interfering with client’s ability to
     perform at a desired level of activity.
  • Determine baseline activity level and physical condition.
     (Provides opportunity to track changes.)
  NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To develop/investigate alternative
  ways to remain active within the limits of the disabling condi-
  tion/situation:
  • Implement physical therapy/exercise program in conjunc-
     tion with the client and other team members (e.g., phys-
     ical and/or occupational therapist, exercise/rehabilitation
     physiologist). Coordination of program enhances likelihood
     of success.
  • Promote/implement conditioning program and support
     inclusion in exercise/activity groups to prevent/limit deterio-
     ration.

  Failure to achieve optimal sense of control
  OBJECTIVE
  Failure to take actions that would prevent further health problems
  Demonstration of nonacceptance of health status change
  Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
  Criteria—Client Will:
  • Demonstrate increasing interest/participation in self-care.
  • Develop ability to assume responsibility for personal needs
     when possible.
  • Identify stress situations leading to impaired adjustment and
     specific actions for dealing with them.

  Actions/Interventions
  NURSING PRIORITY NO. 1. To assess degree of impaired func-
  tion:
  • Perform a physical and/or psychosocial assessment to deter-
     mine the extent of the limitation(s) of the present condition.
  • Listen to the client’s perception of inability/reluctance to
     adapt to situations that are occurring at present.
      Information that appears in brackets has been added by the authors
  to clarify and enhance the use of nursing diagnoses.
6 NURSE’S POCKET GUIDE


• Survey (with the client) past and present significant support
                                                                      Adjustment, impaired
  systems (e.g., family, church, groups, and organizations) to
  identify helpful resources.
• Explore the expressions of emotions signifying impaired
  adjustment by client/SO(s) (e.g., overwhelming anxiety, fear,
  anger, worry, passive and/or active denial).
• Note child’s interaction with parent/care provider (develop-
  ment of coping behaviors is limited at this age, and primary
  care providers provide support for the child and serve as role
  models).
• Determine whether child displays problems with school
  performance, withdraws from family/peers, or demonstrates
  aggressive behavior toward others/self.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.      2. To identify the causative/contribut-
ing factors relating to the impaired adjustment:
• Listen to client’s perception of the factors leading to the pres-
  ent impairment, noting onset, duration, presence/absence of
  physical complaints, social withdrawal.
• Review previous life situations and role changes with client to
  determine coping skills used.
• Determine lack of/inability to use available resources.
• Review available documentation and resources to determine
  actual life experiences (e.g., medical records, statements by
  SO[s], consultants’ notes). In situations of great stress, phys-
  ical and/or emotional, the client may not accurately assess
  occurrences leading to the present situation.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To assist client in coping/dealing with
impairment:
• Organize a team conference (including client and ancillary
  services) to focus on contributing factors of impaired adjust-
  ment and plan for management of the situation.
• Acknowledge client’s efforts to adjust: “Have done your best.”
  Lessens feelings of blame/guilt and defensive response. Share
  information with adolescent’s peers when illness/injury
  affects body image (peers are primary support for this age
  group).
• Explain disease process/causative factors and prognosis as
  appropriate and promote questioning to enhance under-
  standing.
• Provide an open environment encouraging communication
  so that expression of feelings concerning impaired function
  can be dealt with realistically.
• Use therapeutic communication skills (Active-listening,
  acknowledgment, silence, I-statements).
• Discuss/evaluate resources that have been useful to the client
  in adapting to changes in other life situations (e.g., vocational
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                        67


    rehabilitation, employment experiences, psychosocial support
    services).
  • Develop a plan of action with client to meet immediate
    needs (e.g., physical safety and hygiene, emotional support
    of professionals and SO[s]) and assist in implementation of
    the plan. Provides a starting point to deal with current situa-
    tion for moving ahead with plan and for evaluation of
    progress.
  • Explore previously used coping skills and application to
    current situation. Refine/develop new strategies as appro-
    priate.
  • Identify and problem-solve with the client frustration in daily
    care. (Focusing on the smaller factors of concern gives the
    individual the ability to perceive the impaired function from
    a less-threatening perspective, one-step-at-a-time concept.)
  • Involve SO(s) in long-range planning for emotional, psycho-
    logical, physical, and social needs.
  NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
  Discharge Considerations):
  • Identify strengths the client perceives in present life situation.
    Keep focus on the present, as unknowns of the future may be
    too overwhelming.
  • Refer to other resources in the long-range plan of care (e.g.,
    occupational therapy, vocational rehabilitation) as indicated.
  • Assist client/SO(s) to see appropriate alternatives and poten-
    tial changes in locus of control.
  • Assist SO(s) to learn methods of managing present needs.
    (Refer to NDs specific to client’s deficits.)
  • Pace and time learning sessions to meet client’s needs.
    Provide feedback during and after learning experiences (e.g.,
    self-catheterization, range-of-motion exercises, wound care,
    therapeutic communication) to enhance retention, skill, and
    confidence.

  tions. Monitor for signs/symptoms of congestive heart failure
  (crackles, edema, weight gain).
• Encourage/provide warm versus cold liquids as appropriate.
• Provide supplemental humidification, if needed (ultrasonic
  nebulizer, room humidifier).
• Perform/assist client with postural drainage and percussion as
  indicated if not contraindicated by condition, such as asthma.
• Assist with respiratory treatments (intermittent positive-
  pressure breathing—IPPB, incentive spirometer).
• Support reduction/cessation of smoking to improve lung
  function.
• Discourage use of oil-based products around nose to prevent
  aspiration into lungs.

  steroids, expectorants, bronchodilators.
• Observe for signs/symptoms of infection (e.g., increased
  dyspnea with onset of fever, change in sputum color, amount,
  or character) to identify infectious process/promote timely
  intervention. Obtain sputum specimen, preferably before
  antimicrobial therapy is initiated, to verify appropriateness of
  therapy.
• Monitor/document serial chest x-rays/ABGs/pulse oximetry
  readings.
• Observe for improvement in symptoms.

  Definition: An allergic response to natural latex rubber
  products
Related Factors
No immune mechanism response [although this is true of irritant and
  allergic contact dermatitis, type I/immediate reaction is a true aller-
  gic response]
Defining Characteristics
Type I reactions [hypersensitivity; IgE-mediated reaction]: immediate
   reaction (⬍1 hour) to latex proteins (can be life threatening);
   contact urticaria progressing to generalized symptoms; edema of the
   lips, tongue, uvula, and/or throat; shortness of breath, tightness in
   chest, wheezing, bronchospasm leading to respiratory arrest;
   hypotension, syncope, cardiac arrest. May also include: Orofacial
   characteristics—edema of sclera or eyelids; erythema and/or itching
   of the eyes; tearing of the eyes; nasal congestion, itching, and/or
   erythema; rhinorrhea; facial erythema; facial itching; oral itching;
   Gastrointestinal characteristics—abdominal pain; nausea;
   Generalized characteristics—flushing; general discomfort; general-
   ized edema; increasing complaint of total body warmth; restlessness
Type IV reactions [chemical and delayed-type hypersensitivity]:
   delayed onset (hours); eczema; irritation; reaction to additives (e.g.,
   thiurams, carbamates) causes discomfort; redness
Irritant [contact dermatitis] reactions: erythema; [dry, crusty, hard
   bumps] chapped or cracked skin; blisters
Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
Criteria—Client Will:
• Be free of signs of hypersensitive response.
• Verbalize understanding of individual risks/responsibilities in
  avoiding exposure.
• Identify signs/symptoms requiring prompt intervention.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.    1. To assess contributing factors:
• Identify persons in high-risk categories (e.g., those with
  history of allergies, eczema, and other dermatitis); those
  routinely exposed to latex products: healthcare workers,

     police/firefighters, emergency medical technicians (EMTs),
     food handlers (restaurant, grocery stores, cafeterias), hair-
     dressers, cleaning staff, factory workers in plants that manu-
     facture latex-containing products; those with neural tube
     defects (e.g., spina bifida) or congenital urologic conditions
     requiring frequent surgeries and/or catheterizations (e.g.,
     extrophy of the bladder).
  • History of recent exposure, for example, blowing up balloons
     (this might be an acute reaction to the powder); use of
     condoms (may affect either partner).
  • Note presence of positive skin-prick test (SPT). (Sensitive
     indicator of IgE sensitivity reflecting immune system activa-
     tion/type I reaction.)
  • Perform challenge/patch test, if appropriate, placing gloves to
     skin for 15 minutes (appearance of hives, itching, reddened
     areas indicates sensitivity) or assist with/note response to
     radioallergosorbent test (RAST). This is the only safe test for
     the client with a history of type I reaction.
  NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To take measures to reduce/limit
  allergic response/avoid exposure to allergens:
  • Ascertain client’s current symptoms, noting reports of rash,
     hives, itching, eye symptoms, edema, diarrhea, nausea, feeling
     of faintness.
  • Assess skin (usually hands but may be anywhere) for dry,
     crusty, hard bumps, horizontal cracks caused by irritation
     from chemicals used in/on the latex item (e.g., powder in
     gloves, condoms, etc.).
  • Assist with treatment of contact dermatitis/type IV reaction
     (most common response) (e.g., wash affected skin with mild
     soap and water, possible application of topical steroid oint-
     ment, avoidance of latex). Inform client that the most
     common cause is latex gloves, but that many other products
     contain latex and could aggravate condition.
  • Monitor closely for signs of systemic reactions because type
     IV response can lead to/progress to type I anaphylaxis. Be
     watchful for onset of difficulty breathing, wheezing, hypoten-
     sion, tachycardia, dysrhythmias (indicative of anaphylactic
     reaction and can lead to cardiac arrest).
  • Administer treatment as appropriate if type I reaction occurs,
     including antihistamines, epinephrine, IV fluids, corti-
     costeroids, and oxygen mechanical ventilation, if indicated.
  • Post latex precaution signs and document allergy to latex in
     client’s file. Encourage client to wear medical ID bracelet and
     to inform care providers.
  • Survey and routinely monitor client’s environment for latex-
     containing products and remove.

    pulmonary disease, anemia, dysrhythmias; use of steroids,
    thyroid, appetite control medications; and substance abuse).
  • Identify client’s perception of the threat represented by the
    situation.
  • Monitor physical responses; for example, palpitations/rapid
    pulse, repetitive movements, pacing.
  • Observe behavior indicative of level of anxiety (the nurse
    needs to be aware of own feelings of anxiety or uneasiness,
    which can be a clue to the client’s level of anxiety):
  Mild:
  Alert, more aware of environment, attention focused on environment
    and immediate events.
  Restless, irritable, wakeful, reports of insomnia.
  Motivated to deal with existing problems in this state.
  Moderate:
  Perception narrower, concentration increased and able to ignore
    distractions in dealing with problem(s).
  Voice quivers or changes pitch.
  Trembling, increased pulse/respirations.
  Severe:
  Range of perception is reduced; anxiety interferes with effective func-
    tioning.
  Preoccupied with feelings of discomfort/sense of impending doom.
  Increased pulse/respirations with reports of dizziness, tingling sensa-
    tions, headache, and so on.
  Panic:
  Ability to concentrate is disrupted; behavior is disintegrated; the client
    distorts the situation and does not have realistic perceptions of what
    is happening. The individual may be experiencing terror or confu-
    sion or be unable to speak or move (paralyzed with fear).
  • Note use of drugs (alcohol), insomnia or excessive sleeping,
    limited/avoidance of interactions with others, which may be
    behavioral indicators of use of withdrawal to deal with prob-
    lems.
  • Be aware of defense mechanisms being used (client may be in
    denial, regression, and so forth) that interfere with ability to
    deal with problem.
  • Identify coping skills the individual is using currently, such as
    anger, daydreaming, forgetfulness, eating, smoking, lack of
    problem-solving.
  • Review coping skills used in past to determine those that
    might be helpful in current circumstances.
  NURSING PRIORITY NO.        2. To assist client to identify feelings and
  begin to deal with problems:
  • Establish a therapeutic relationship, conveying empathy and
    unconditional positive regard.
  • Be available to client for listening and talking.

    (fear, anger).
•   Assist client to develop self-awareness of verbal and nonverbal
    behaviors.
•   Clarify meaning of feelings/actions by providing feedback and
    checking meaning with the client.
•   Acknowledge anxiety/fear. Do not deny or reassure client that
    everything will be all right.
•   Provide accurate information about the situation. Helps
    client to identify what is reality based.
•   Be truthful with child, avoid bribing, and provide physical
    contact (e.g., hugging, rocking) to soothe fears and provide
    assurance.
•   Provide comfort measures (e.g., calm/quiet environment, soft
    music, warm bath, back rub).
•   Modify procedures as possible (e.g., substitute oral for intra-
    muscular medications, combine blood draws/use fingerstick
    method) to limit degree of stress, avoid overwhelming child.
•   Manage environmental factors, such as harsh lighting and
    high traffic flow, which may be confusing/stressful to older
    individuals.
•   Accept client as is. (The client may need to be where he or she
    is at this point in time, such as in denial after receiving the
    diagnosis of a terminal illness.)
•   Allow the behavior to belong to the client; do not respond
    personally because this may escalate the situation.
•   Assist client to use anxiety for coping with the situation, if
    helpful. (Moderate anxiety heightens awareness and permits
    the client to focus on dealing with problems.)
Panic State
• Stay with client, maintaining a calm, confident manner.
• Speak in brief statements using simple words.
• Provide for nonthreatening, consistent environment/atmos-
  phere. Minimize stimuli. Monitor visitors and interactions to
  lessen effect of transmission of feelings.
• Set limits on inappropriate behavior and help client to
  develop acceptable ways of dealing with anxiety. Note: Staff
  may need to provide safe controls/environment until client
  regains control.
• Gradually increase activities/involvement with others as anxi-
  ety is decreased.
• Use cognitive therapy to focus on/correct faulty catastrophic
  interpretations of physical symptoms.
• Give antianxiety medications (antianxiety agents/sedatives) as
  ordered.

  NOTE: A risk diagnosis is not evidenced by signs and symptoms, as
  the problem has not occurred and nursing interventions are
  directed at prevention.
Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
Criteria—Client Will:
• Experience no aspiration as evidenced by noiseless respira-
  tions, clear breath sounds; clear, odorless secretions.
• Identify causative/risk factors.
• Demonstrate techniques to prevent and/or correct aspiration.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Note level of consciousness/awareness of surroundings,
  cognitive impairment.
• Evaluate presence of neuromuscular weakness, noting muscle
  groups involved, degree of impairment, and whether they are
  of an acute or progressive nature (e.g., Guillain-Barré,
  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis—ALS).
• Assess amount and consistency of respiratory secretions and
  strength of gag/cough reflex.
• Observe for neck and facial edema, for example, client with
  head/neck surgery, tracheal/bronchial injury (upper torso
  burns, inhalation/chemical injury).
• Note administration of enteral feedings, being aware of
  potential for regurgitation and/or misplacement of tube.
• Ascertain lifestyle habits, for instance, use of alcohol, tobacco,
  and other drugs; can affect awareness and muscles of gag/
  swallow.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.   2. To assist in correcting factors that can
lead to aspiration:
• Monitor use of oxygen masks in clients at risk for vomiting.
  Refrain from using oxygen masks for comatose individuals.
• Keep wire cutters/scissors with client at all times when jaws
  are wired/banded to facilitate clearing airway in emergency
  situations.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                            87


  • Maintain operational suction equipment at bedside/chairside.
  • Suction (oral cavity, nose, and ET/tracheostomy tube) as
    needed to clear secretions. Avoid triggering gag mechanism
    when performing suction or mouth care.
  • Assist with postural drainage to mobilize thickened secre-
    tions that may interfere with swallowing.
  • Auscultate lung sounds frequently (especially in client who is
    coughing frequently or not coughing at all; ventilator client
    being tube-fed) to determine presence of secretions/silent
    aspiration.
  • Elevate client to highest or best possible position for eating
    and drinking and during tube feedings.
  • Feed slowly, instruct client to chew slowly and thoroughly.
  • Give semisolid foods; avoid pureed foods (increased risk of
    aspiration) and mucus-producing foods (milk). Use soft
    foods that stick together/form a bolus (e.g., casseroles,
    puddings, stews) to aid swallowing effort.
  • Provide very warm or very cold liquids (activates tempera-
    ture receptors in the mouth that help to stimulate swallow-
    ing). Add thickening agent to liquids as appropriate.
  • Avoid washing solids down with liquids.
  • Ascertain that feeding tube is in correct position. Measure
    residuals when appropriate to prevent overfeeding. Add food
    coloring to feeding to identify regurgitation.
  • Determine best position for infant/child (e.g., with the head
    of bed elevated 30 degrees and infant propped on right side
    after feeding because upper airway patency is facilitated by
    upright position and turning to right side decreases likeli-
    hood of drainage into trachea).
  • Provide oral medications in elixir form or crush, if appro-
    priate.
  • Refer to speech therapist for exercises to strengthen muscles
    and techniques to enhance swallowing.
  NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote wellness (Teaching/
  Discharge Considerations):
  • Review individual risk/potentiating factors.
  • Provide information about the effects of aspiration on the
    lungs.
  • Instruct in safety concerns when feeding oral or tube feeding.
    Refer to ND Swallowing, impaired.
  • Train client to suction self or train family members in suction
    techniques (especially if client has constant or copious oral
    secretions) to enhance safety/self-sufficiency.
  • Instruct individual/family member to avoid/limit activities
    that increase intra-abdominal pressure (straining, strenuous
    exercise, tight/constrictive clothing), which may slow diges-
    tion/increase risk of regurgitation.

  effects of therapeutic regimen).
• Verbalize relief of anxiety and adaptation to actual/altered

• Recognize and incorporate body image change into self-
  concept in accurate manner without negating self-esteem.
• Seek information and actively pursue growth.
• Acknowledge self as an individual who has responsibility for
  self.
• Use adaptive devices/prosthesis appropriately.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Discuss pathophysiology present and/or situation affecting
  the individual and refer to additional NDs as appropriate. For
  example, when alteration in body image is related to neuro-
  logic deficit (e.g., cerebrovascular accident—CVA), refer to
  ND Unilateral Neglect; in the presence of severe, ongoing
  pain, refer to Pain, chronic; or in loss of sexual desire/ability,
  refer to Sexual Dysfunction.
• Determine whether condition is permanent/no hope for reso-
  lution. (May be associated with other NDs, such as Self-
  Esteem [specify] or Attachment, risk for impaired parent/
  infant/child when child is affected.)
• Assess mental/physical influence of illness/condition on the
  client’s emotional state (e.g., diseases of the endocrine system,
  use of steroid therapy, and so on).
• Evaluate level of client’s knowledge of and anxiety related to
  situation. Observe emotional changes.
• Recognize behavior indicative of overconcern with body and
  its processes.
• Have client describe self, noting what is positive and what is
  negative. Be aware of how client believes others see self.
• Discuss meaning of loss/change to client. A small (seemingly
  trivial) loss may have a big impact (such as the use of a
  urinary catheter or enema for continence). A change in func-
  tion (such as immobility) may be more difficult for some to
  deal with than a change in appearance. Permanent facial

     for determining exact expression of body image in child
     (e.g., puppet play or constructive dialogue for toddler).
     Developmental capacity must guide interaction to gain accu-
     rate information.
   • Note signs of grieving/indicators of severe or prolonged
     depression to evaluate need for counseling and/or medica-
     tions.
   • Determine ethnic background and cultural/religious percep-
     tions and considerations.
   • Identify social aspects of illness/disease (e.g., sexually trans-
     mitted diseases, sterility, chronic conditions).
   • Observe interaction of client with SO(s). Distortions in body
     image may be unconsciously reinforced by family members,
     and/or secondary gain issues may interfere with progress.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To determine coping abilities and
   skills:
   • Assess client’s current level of adaptation and progress.
   • Listen to client’s comments and responses to the situation.
     Different situations are upsetting to different people,
     depending on individual coping skills and past experiences.
   • Note withdrawn behavior and the use of denial. May be
     normal response to situation or may be indicative of mental
     illness (e.g., schizophrenia). (Refer to ND Denial, ineffective.)
   • Note use of addictive substances/alcohol; may reflect
     dysfunctional coping.
   • Identify previously used coping strategies and effectiveness.
   • Determine individual/family/community resources.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To assist client and SO(s) to deal
   with/accept issues of self-concept related to body image:
   • Establish therapeutic nurse-client relationship conveying an
     attitude of caring and developing a sense of trust.
   • Visit client frequently and acknowledge the individual as
     someone who is worthwhile. Provides opportunities for
     listening to concerns and questions.
   • Assist in correcting underlying problems to promote optimal
     healing/adaptation.
   • Provide assistance with self-care needs/measures as necessary
     while promoting individual abilities/independence.
   • Work with client’s self-concept without moral judgments
     regarding client’s efforts or progress (e.g., “You should be
     progressing faster; you’re weak/lazy/not trying hard enough”).
   • Discuss concerns about fear of mutilation, prognosis, rejec-
     tion when client facing surgery or potentially poor outcome
     of procedure/illness, to address realities and provide
     emotional support.
   • Acknowledge and accept feelings of dependency, grief, and
     hostility.

• Encourage client and SO(s) to communicate feelings to each
  other.
• Assume all individuals are sensitive to changes in appearance
  but avoid stereotyping.
• Alert staff to monitor own facial expressions and other
  nonverbal behaviors because they need to convey acceptance
  and not revulsion when the client’s appearance is affected.
• Encourage family members to treat client normally and not as
  an invalid.
• Encourage client to look at/touch affected body part to begin
  to incorporate changes into body image.
• Allow client to use denial without participating (e.g., client
  may at first refuse to look at a colostomy; the nurse says “I am
  going to change your colostomy now” and proceeds with the
  task). Provides individual time to adapt to situation.
• Set limits on maladaptive behavior and assist client to identify
  positive behaviors to aid in recovery.
• Provide accurate information as desired/requested. Reinforce
  previously given information.
• Discuss the availability of prosthetics, reconstructive surgery,
  and physical/occupational therapy or other referrals as
  dictated by individual situation.
• Help client to select and use clothing/makeup to minimize
  body changes and enhance appearance.
• Discuss reasons for infectious isolation and procedures when
  used and make time to sit down and talk/listen to client while
  in the room to decrease sense of isolation/loneliness.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
Discharge Considerations):
• Begin counseling/other therapies (e.g., biofeedback/relax-

NURSING PRIORITY NO.       1. To identify causative/risk factors
present:
• Determine if present illness/condition results from exposure
  to environmental factors, surgery, infection, trauma.
• Monitor laboratory values (e.g., tests indicative of infection,
  drug screens).
• Note client’s age (e.g., premature neonate, young child, or
  aging individual), as it can directly impact ability to main-
  tain/regulate body temperature and respond to changes in
  environment.
• Assess nutritional status.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.       2. To prevent occurrence of tempera-
ture alteration:
• Monitor/maintain comfortable ambient environment.
  Provide heating/cooling measures as indicated.
• Cover head with knit cap, place infant under radiant warmer
  or adequate blankets. Heat loss in newborn/infants is greatest
  through head and by evaporation and convection.
• Monitor core body temperature. (Tympanic temperature may
  be preferred, as it is the most accurate noninvasive method.)

Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.         1. To identify maternal causative/
contributing factors:
• Assess client knowledge about breastfeeding and extent of
  instruction that has been given.
• Encourage discussion of current/previous breastfeeding expe-
  rience(s).
• Note previous unsatisfactory experience (including self or
  others) because it may be affecting current situation.
• Do physical assessment, noting appearance of breasts/
  nipples, marked asymmetry of breasts, obvious inverted or
  flat nipples, minimal or no breast enlargement during preg-
  nancy.
• Determine whether lactation failure is primary (i.e., maternal
  prolactin deficiency/serum prolactin levels, inadequate
  mammary gland tissue, breast surgery that has damaged the
  nipple, areola enervation-irremediable) or secondary (i.e.,
  sore nipples, severe engorgement, plugged milk ducts, masti-
  tis, inhibition of letdown reflex, maternal/infant separation
  with disruption of feedings-treatable).
• Note history of pregnancy, labor and delivery (vaginal or
  cesarean section), other recent or current surgery; preexisting
  medical problems (e.g., diabetes, epilepsy, cardiac diseases, or
  presence of disabilities).
• Identify maternal support systems; presence and response of

   • Determine maternal feelings (e.g., fear/anxiety, ambivalence,
     depression).
   • Ascertain cultural expectations/conflicts.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assess infant causative/contribut-
   ing factors:
   • Determine suckling problems, as noted in Related Factors/
     Defining Characteristics.
   • Note prematurity and/or infant anomaly (e.g., cleft palate).
   • Review feeding schedule, to note increased demand for feed-
     ing (at least 8 times/day, taking both breasts at each feeding
     for more than 15 minutes on each side) or use of supple-
     ments with artificial nipple.
   • Evaluate observable signs of inadequate infant intake (e.g.,
     baby latches onto mother’s nipples with sustained suckling
     but minimal audible swallowing/gulping noted, infant arch-
     ing and crying at the breasts with resistance to latching on,
     decreased urinary output/frequency of stools, inadequate
     weight gain).
   • Determine whether baby is content after feeding, or exhibits
     fussiness and crying within the first hour after breastfeeding,
     suggesting unsatisfactory breastfeeding process.
   • Note any correlation between maternal ingestion of certain
     foods and “colicky” response of infant.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        3. To assist mother to develop skills of
   adequate breastfeeding:
   • Give emotional support to mother. Use 1:1 instruction with
     each feeding during hospital stay/clinic visit.
   • Inform mother that some babies do not cry when they are
     hungry; instead some make “rooting” motions and suck their
     fingers.
   • Recommend avoidance or overuse of supplemental feedings
     and pacifiers (unless specifically indicated) that can lessen
     infant’s desire to breastfeed.
   • Restrict use of breast shields (i.e., only temporarily to help
     draw the nipple out), then place baby directly on nipple.
   • Demonstrate use of electric piston-type breast pump with
     bilateral collection chamber when necessary to maintain or
     increase milk supply.
   • Encourage frequent rest periods, sharing household/child-
     care duties to limit fatigue and facilitate relaxation at feeding
     times.
   • Suggest abstinence/restriction of tobacco, caffeine, alcohol,
     drugs, excess sugar because they may affect milk produc-
     tion/letdown reflex or be passed on to the infant.

  chambers at least 8 to 12 times/day.
Sore nipples: Wear 100% cotton fabrics, do not use soap/alcohol/
  drying agents on nipples, avoid use of nipple shields or nursing pads
  that contain plastic; cleanse and then air dry, use thin layers of lano-
  lin (if mother/baby not sensitive to wool); provide exposure to
  sunlight/sunlamps with extreme caution; administer mild pain
  reliever as appropriate, apply ice before nursing; soak with warm
  water before attaching infant to soften nipple and remove dried
  milk, begin with least sore side or begin with hand expression to
  establish letdown reflex, properly position infant on breast/
  nipple, and use a variety of nursing positions.
Clogged ducts: Use larger bra or extender to avoid pressure on site; use
  moist or dry heat, gently massage from above plug down to nipple;
  nurse infant, hand express, or pump after massage; nurse more
  often on affected side.
Inhibited letdown: Use relaxation techniques before nursing (e.g.,
  maintain quiet atmosphere, assume position of comfort, massage,
  apply heat to breasts, have beverage available); develop a routine for
  nursing, concentrate on infant; administer synthetic oxytocin nasal
  spray as appropriate.
Mastitis: Promote bedrest (with infant) for several days; administer
  antibiotics; provide warm, moist heat before and during nursing;
  empty breasts completely, continuing to nurse baby at least 8 to 12
  times/day, or pumping breasts for 24 hours; then resuming breast-
  feeding as appropriate.

  tems.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.       2. To identify the causative/contribut-
ing factors relating to the impairment:
• Note presence of high-risk situations (e.g., elderly client with
  total self-care dependence, or family with several small chil-
  dren with one child requiring extensive assistance due to
  physical condition/developmental delays). May necessitate
  role reversal resulting in added stress or place excessive
  demands on parenting skills.

     and so forth. Note results of neurologic testing such as elec-
     troencephalogram (EEG), computed tomography (CT) scan.
   • Note whether aphasia is motor (expressive: loss of images for
     articulated speech), sensory (receptive: unable to understand
     words and does not recognize the defect), conduction (slow
     comprehension, uses words inappropriately but knows the
     error), and/or global (total loss of ability to comprehend and
     speak). Evaluate the degree of impairment.
   • Evaluate mental status, note presence of psychotic conditions

    (e.g., manic-depressive, schizoid/affective behavior). Assess
                                                                         Communication, impaired verbal
    psychologic response to communication impairment, willing-
    ness to find alternate means of communication.
•   Note presence of ET tube/tracheostomy or other physical
    blocks to speech (e.g., cleft palate, jaws wired).
•   Assess environmental factors that may affect ability to
    communicate (e.g., room noise level).
•   Determine primary language spoken and cultural factors.
•   Assess style of speech (as outlined in Defining Character-
    istics).
•   Note level of anxiety present; presence of angry, hostile behav-
    ior; frustration.
•   Interview parent to determine child’s developmental level of
    speech and language comprehension.
•   Note parent’s speech patterns and manner of communicating
    with child, including gestures.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.      2. To assist client to establish a means of
communication to express needs, wants, ideas, and questions:
• Determine ability to read/write. Evaluate musculoskeletal
  states, including manual dexterity (e.g., ability to hold a pen
  and write).
• Obtain a translator/written translation or picture chart when
  writing is not possible.
• Facilitate hearing and vision examinations/obtaining neces-
  sary aids when needed/desired for improving communica-
  tion. Assist client to learn to use and adjust to aids.
• Establish relationship with the client, listening carefully and
  attending to client’s verbal/nonverbal expressions.
• Maintain eye contact, preferably at client’s level. Be aware of
  cultural factors that may preclude eye contact (e.g., some
  Native-Americans).
• Keep communication simple, using all modes for accessing
  information: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.
• Maintain a calm, unhurried manner. Provide sufficient time
  for client to respond. Individuals with expressive aphasia
  may talk more easily when they are rested and relaxed and
  when they are talking to one person at a time.
• Determine meaning of words used by the client and congru-
  ency of communication and nonverbal messages.
• Validate meaning of nonverbal communication; do not make
  assumptions, because they may be wrong. Be honest; if you
  do not understand, seek assistance from others.
• Individualize techniques using breathing for relaxation of the
  vocal cords, rote tasks (such as counting), and singing or
  melodic intonation to assist aphasic clients relearn speech.
• Anticipate needs until effective communication is reestab-
  lished.

     with reality; or reduce stimuli to lessen anxiety that may
     worsen problem.
   • Use confrontation skills, when appropriate, within an estab-
     lished nurse-client relationship to clarify discrepancies
     between verbal and nonverbal cues.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Review information about condition, prognosis, and treat-
     ment with client/SO(s). Reinforce that loss of speech does not
     imply loss of intelligence.
   • Discuss individual methods of dealing with impairment.
   • Recommend placing a tape recorder with a prerecorded
     emergency message near the telephone. Information to
     include: client’s name, address, telephone number, type of
     airway, and that emergency assistance is immediately
     required.
   • Use and assist client/SO(s) to learn therapeutic communica-
     tion skills of acknowledgment, Active-listening, and I-
     messages. Improves general communication skills.
   • Involve family/SO(s) in plan of care as much as possible.
     Enhances participation and commitment to plan.
   • Refer to appropriate resources (e.g., speech therapist, group
     therapy, individual/family and/or psychiatric counseling).

    Information that appears in brackets has been added by the authors
 to clarify and enhance the use of nursing diagnoses.

   • Be able to express information, thoughts, and feelings in a
     satisfactory manner.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO 1. To assess how client is managing
   communication and potential difficulties:
   • Ascertain circumstances that result in client’s desire to
     improve communication. Many factors are involved in
     communication, and identifying specific needs/expectations
     help in developing realistic goals and determining likelihood
     of success.
   • Evaluate mental status. Disorientation and psychotic condi-
     tions may be affecting speech and the communication of
     thoughts, needs, and desires.
   • Determine client’s developmental level of speech and
     language comprehension. Provides baseline information for
     developing plan for improvement.
   • Determine ability to read/write. Evaluating grasp of language
     as well as musculoskeletal states, including manual dexterity
     (e.g., ability to hold a pen and write), provides information
     about nature of client’s situation. Educational plan can
     address language skills. Neuromuscular deficits will require
     individual program to correct.
   • Determine country of origin, dominant language, whether
     client is recent immigrant and what cultural, ethnic group
     client identifies as own. Recent immigrant may identify with
     home country, and its people, language, beliefs, and health-
     care practices affecting desire to learn language and improve
     ability to interact in new country.
   • Ascertain if interpreter is needed/desired. Law mandates that
     interpretation services be made available. Trained, profes-
     sional interpreter who translates precisely and possesses a
     basic understanding of medical terminology and healthcare
     ethics is preferred to enhance client and provider satisfac-
     tion.
   • Determine comfort level in expression of feelings and
     concepts in nonproficient language. Anxiety about language
     difficulty can interfere with ability to communicate effec-
     tively.
   • Note any physical barriers to effective communication (e.g.,
     talking tracheostomy, wired jaws) or physiologic/neurologic
     conditions (e.g., severe shortness of breath, neuromuscular
     weakness, stroke, brain trauma, hearing impairment, cleft
     palate, facial trauma). Client may be dealing with
     speech/language comprehension or have voice production
     problems (pitch, loudness, or quality), which call attention to
     voice rather than what speaker is saying. These barriers will
40 N U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E


    need to be addressed to enable client to improve communi-
                                                                       Communication, readiness for enhanced
    cation skills.
•   Clarify meaning of words used by the client to describe
    important aspects of life and health/well-being (e.g., pain,
    sorrow, anxiety). Words can easily be misinterpreted when
    sender and receiver have different ideas about their mean-
    ings. This can affect the way both client and caregiver
    communicate important concepts. Restating what one has
    heard can clarify whether an expressed statement has been
    understood or misinterpreted.
•   Evaluate level of anxiety, frustration, or fear; presence of
    angry, hostile behavior. Emotional/psychiatric issues can
    affect communication and interfere with understanding.
•   Evaluate congruency of verbal and nonverbal messages. It is
    estimated that 65% to 95% of communication is nonverbal,
    and communication is enhanced when verbal and nonverbal
    messages are congruent.
•   Determine lack of knowledge or misunderstanding of terms
    related to client’s specific situation. Indicators of need for
    additional information, clarification to help client improve
    ability to communicate.
•   Evaluate need/desire for pictures or written communications
    and instructions as part of treatment plan. Alternative meth-
    ods of communication can help client feel understood and
    promote feelings of satisfaction with interaction.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To improve client’s ability to commu-
nicate thoughts, needs, and ideas:
• Maintain a calm, unhurried manner. Provide sufficient time
  for client to respond. An atmosphere in which client is free
  to speak without fear of criticism provides the opportunity
  to explore all the issues involved in making decisions to
  improve communication skills.
• Pay attention to speaker. Be an active listener. The use of
  Active-listening communicates acceptance and respect for
  the client, establishing trust and promoting openness and
  honest expression. It communicates a belief that the client is
  a capable and competent person.
• Sit down, maintain eye contact, preferably at client’s level, and
  spend time with the client. Conveys message that the nurse
  has time and interest in communicating.
• Observe body language, eye movements, and behavioral clues.
  May reveal unspoken concerns, for example, when pain is
  present, client may react with tears, grimacing, stiff posture,
  turning away, and angry outbursts.
• Help client identify and learn to avoid use of nontherapeu-
  tic communication. These barriers are recognized as detri-
  ments to open communication and learning to avoid them
        NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                       141


     maximizes the effectiveness of communication between
     client and others.
   • Establish hand/eye signals if indicated. Neurologic impair-
     ments may allow client to understand language but not
     be able to speak and/or may have a physical barrier to
     writing.
   • Obtain interpreter with language or signing abilities as
     needed. May be needed to enhance understanding of words,
     language concepts, or needs to promote accurate interpreta-
     tion of communication.
   • Provide pad and pencil, slate board, letter/picture board,
     if indicated. When client has physical impairments that
     interfere with spoken communication, alternate means
     can provide concepts that are understandable to both
     parties.
   • Obtain/provide access to typewriter/computer. Use of these
     devices may be more helpful when impairment is long-
     standing or when client is used to using them.
   • Respect client’s cultural communication needs. Different cul-
     tures can dictate beliefs of what is normal or abnormal (i.e.,
     in some cultures, eye-to-eye contact is considered disrespect-
     ful, impolite, or an invasion of privacy; silence and tone of
     voice has various meanings, and slang words can cause
     confusion).
   • Provide glasses, hearing aids, dentures, electronic speech devi-
     ces as needed. These devices maximize sensory perception
     and can improve understanding and enhance speech
     patterns.
   • Reduce distractions and background noises (e.g., close the
     door, turn down the radio/TV). A distracting environment
     can interfere with communication, limiting attention to tasks
     and making speech and communication more difficult.
     Reducing noise can help both parties hear clearly, improving
     understanding.
   • Associate words with objects using repetition and redun-
     dancy, point to objects, or demonstrate desired actions.
     Speaker’s own body language can be used to enhance client’s
     understanding when neurologic conditions result in diffi-
     culty understanding language.
   • Use confrontation skills carefully when appropriate, within an
     established nurse-client relationship. Can be used to clarify
     discrepancies between verbal and nonverbal cues, enabling
     client to look at areas that may require change.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        3. To promote optimum communica-
   tion:
   • Discuss with family/SO and other caregivers effective ways in
42 N U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E


  which the client communicates. Identifying positive aspects
                                                                  Communication, readiness for enhanced
  of current communication skills enables family members to
  learn and move forward in desire to enhance ways of inter-
  acting.
• Encourage client and family use of successful techniques for
  communication, whether it is speech/language techniques
  or alternate modes of communicating. Enhances family
  relationships and promotes self-esteem for all members as
  they are able to communicate clearly regardless of the prob-
  lems which have interfered with ability to interact.
• Reinforce client/SO(s) learning and use of therapeutic
  communication skills of acknowledgment, Active-listening,
  and I-messages. Improves general communication skills,
  emphasizes acceptance, and conveys respect enabling family
  relationships to improve.
• Refer to appropriate resources (e.g., speech therapist,
  language classes, individual/family and/or psychiatric coun-
  seling). May need further assistance to overcome problems
  that are preventing family from reaching desired goal of
  enhanced communication.

  ment).
• Monitor/adjust medication regimen and note response.
  Eliminate nonessential drugs as appropriate.
• Orient client to surroundings, staff, necessary activities as
  needed. Present reality concisely and briefly. Avoid challeng-
  ing illogical thinking—defensive reactions may result.
• Encourage family/SO(s) to participate in reorientation as well
  as providing ongoing input (e.g., current news and family
  happenings).
• Maintain calm environment and eliminate extraneous
  noise/stimuli to prevent overstimulation. Provide normal
  levels of essential sensory/tactile stimulation—include
  personal items/pictures, and so on.
• Encourage client to use vision/hearing aids when needed.
• Give simple directions. Allow sufficient time for client to
  respond, to communicate, to make decisions.
• Provide for safety needs (e.g., supervision, siderails, seizure
  precautions, placing call bell within reach, positioning needed

NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To determine needs and desire for
improvement:
• Evaluate ability to understand events, provide realistic
  appraisal of situation. Provides information about client’s
  perception, cognitive ability, and whether the client is aware
  of the facts of the situation. This is essential for planning
  care.
• Determine stressors that are currently affecting client.
  Accurate identification of situation that client is dealing with
  provides information for planning interventions to enhance
  coping abilities.
• Identify social supports available to client. Available support
  systems, such as family and friends, can provide client with
  ability to handle current stressful events and often “talking it
  out” with an empathic listener will help client move forward
  to enhance coping skills.
• Review coping strategies client is aware of and using. The
  desire to improve one’s coping ability is based on an aware-
  ness of the current status of the stressful situation.
• Determine alcohol intake, other drug use, smoking habits,
  sleeping and eating patterns. Use of these substances impairs
  ability to deal with anxiety and affects ability to cope with
  life’s stressors. Identification of impaired sleeping and eating
  patterns provides clues to need for change.
• Assess level of anxiety and coping on an ongoing basis.
  Provides information for baseline to develop plan of care to
  improve coping abilities.
• Note speech and communication patterns. Assesses abil-
  ity to understand and provides information necessary
  to help client make progress in desire to enhance coping
  abilities.
• Evaluate client’s decision-making ability. Understanding
  client’s ability provides a starting point for developing plan
  and determining what information client needs to develop
  more effective coping skills.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.    2. To assist client to develop enhanced
coping skills:
• Active-listen and identify client’s perceptions of current
  status. Reflecting client’s statements and thoughts can
  provide a forum for understanding perceptions in relation to
  reality for planning care and determining accuracy of inter-
  ventions needed.
• Determine previous methods of dealing with life problems.
  Enables client to identify successful techniques used in the
  past promoting feelings of confidence in own ability.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                       183


   • Discuss desire to improve ability to manage stressors of life.
     Understanding motivation behind decision to seek new
     information to enhance life will help client know what is
     needed to learn new skills of coping.
   • Discuss understanding of concept of knowing what can and
     cannot be changed. Acceptance of reality that some things
     cannot be changed allows client to focus energies on dealing
     with things that can be changed.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        3. To promote optimum wellness:
   • Discuss predisposing factors related to any individual’s
     response to stress. Understanding that genetic influences,
     past experiences, and existing conditions determine whether
     a person’s response is adaptive or maladaptive will give client
     a base on which to continue to learn what is needed to
     improve life.
   • Assist client to develop a stress management program. An
     individualized program of relaxation, meditation, involve-
     ment with caring for others/pets will enhance coping skills
     and strengthen client’s ability to manage challenging situa-
     tions.
   • Help client develop problem-solving skills. Learning the
     process for problem solving will promote successful resolu-
     tion of potentially stressful situations that arise.
   • Encourage involvement in activities of interest, such as exer-
     cise/sports, music, and art. Individuals must decide for them-
     selves what coping strategies are adaptive for them.
     Most people find enjoyment and relaxation in these kinds of
     activities.
   • Discuss possibility of doing volunteer work in an area of
     the client’s choosing. Many people report satisfaction in
     helping others and client may find pleasure in such involve-
     ment.
   • Refer to classes and/or reading material as appropriate. May
     be helpful to further learning and pursuing goal of enhanced
     coping ability.

  Death Syndrome, risk for sudden infant
  Taxonomy II: Safety/Protection—Class 2 Physical Injury
  (00156)
  [Diagnostic Division: Safety]
  Submitted 2002
  Definition: Presence of risk factors for sudden death of
  an infant under 1 year of age [Sudden Infant Death
  Syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under
  1 year of age, which remains unexplained after a thor-
  ough case investigation, including performance of a
  complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and
  review of the clinical history. SIDS is a subset of Sudden
  Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) that is the sudden
  and unexpected death of an infant due to natural or
  unnatural causes.]
Risk Factors
MODIFIABLE
Delayed or nonattendance of prenatal care
Infants placed to sleep in the prone or side-lying position
Soft underlayment/loose articles in the sleep environment
Infant overheating/overwrapping
Prenatal and postnatal smoke exposure
POTENTIALLY MODIFIABLE
Young maternal age
Low birth weight; prematurity

 to clarify and enhance the use of nursing diagnoses.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                           185


   NONMODIFIABLE
   Male gender
   Ethnicity (e.g., African-American, Native-American race of mother)
   Seasonality of SIDS deaths (higher in winter and fall months)
   SIDS mortality peaks between infant aged 2 to 4 months
     NOTE: A risk diagnosis is not evidenced by signs and symptoms, as
     the problem has not occurred and nursing interventions are
     directed at prevention.
   Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
   Criteria—Client Will:
   • Verbalize knowledge of modifiable factors that can be
      addressed.
   • Make changes in environment to prevent death occurring
      from other factors.
   • Follow medically recommended prenatal and postnatal care.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.            1. To assess causative/contributing
   factors:
   • Identify individual risk factors pertaining to situation.
      Determines modifiable or potentially modifiable factors
      that can be addressed and treated. SIDS is the most com-
      mon cause of death between 2 weeks and 1 year of age,
      with peak incidence occurring between the 2nd and 4th
      month.
   • Determine ethnicity, cultural background of family. Although
      distribution is worldwide, African-American babies are twice
      as likely to die of SIDS and American-Indian babies are
      nearly three times more likely to die than white babies.
   • Note whether mother smoked during pregnancy or is
      currently smoking. Smoking is known to negatively affect
      the fetus prenatally as well as after birth. Some reports
      indicate an increased risk of SIDS in babies of smoking
      mothers.
   • Assess extent of prenatal care and extent to which mother
      followed recommended care measures. Prenatal care is
      important for all pregnancies to afford the optimal opportu-
      nity for all infants to have a healthy start to life.
   • Note use of alcohol or other drugs/medications during and
      after pregnancy that may have a negative impact on the devel-
      oping fetus. Enables management to minimize any damaging
      effects. (Note: Infants of American-Indian mothers who
      drank any amount of alcohol 3 months before conception
      through the first trimester had six times the risk of SIDS as
      those whose mothers did not drink.)

NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To promote use of activities to mini-
                                                                    Death Syndrome, risk for sudden infant
mize risk of SIDS:
• Recommend that baby be placed on his or her back to sleep,
  both at nighttime and naptime. Research shows that fewer
  babies die of SIDS when they sleep on their backs.
• Advise all caregivers of the infant regarding the importance
  of maintaining correct sleep position. Anyone who will
  have responsibility for the care of the child during sleep
  needs to be reminded of the importance of the back sleep
  position.
• Encourage parents to schedule awake tummy time with
  infant. This activity promotes strengthening of back and
  neck muscles while parents are close and baby is not sleeping.
• Encourage early and medically recommended prenatal care
  and continue with well-baby checkups and immunizations
  after birth. Include information about signs of premature
  labor and actions to be taken to avoid problems if possible.
  Prematurity presents many problems for the newborn and
  keeping babies healthy prevents problems that could put the
  infant at risk for SIDS. Immunizing infants prevents many
  illnesses that can also be life threatening.
• Encourage breastfeeding, if possible. Recommend sitting up
  in chair when nursing at night. Breastfeeding has many
  advantages, immunological, nutritional, and psychosocial
  promoting a healthy infant. Although this does not preclude
  the occurrence of SIDS, healthy babies are less prone to many
  illnesses/problems. The risk of the mother falling asleep
  while feeding infant in bed with resultant accidental suffoca-
  tion has been shown to be of concern.
• Discuss issues of bedsharing and the concerns regarding
  sudden and unexpected infant deaths from accidental entrap-
  ment under a sleeping adult or suffocation by becoming
  wedged in a couch or cushioned chair. Bedsharing or putting
  infant to sleep in an unsafe situation results in dangerous
  sleep environments that place infants at substantial risk for
  SUDI or SIDS.
• Note cultural beliefs about bedsharing. Bedsharing is more
  common among breastfed infants and mothers who are
  young, unmarried, low income, or from a minority group.
  Additional study is needed to better understand bedsharing
  practices and its associated risks and benefits.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote wellness (Teaching/
Discharge Considerations):
• Discuss known facts about SIDS with parents. Corrects
  misconceptions and helps reduce level of anxiety.
• Avoid overdressing or overheating infants during sleep.
  Infants dressed in two or more layers of clothes as they
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                     187


     slept had six times the risk of SIDS as those dressed in fewer
     layers.
   • Place the baby on a firm mattress in an approved crib.
     Avoiding soft mattresses, sofas, cushions, waterbeds, other
     soft surfaces, while not known to prevent SIDS, will mini-
     mize chance of suffocation/SUDI.
   • Remove fluffy and loose bedding from sleep area making sure
     baby’s head and face are not covered during sleep. Minimizes
     possibility of suffocation.
   • Discuss the use of apnea monitors. Apnea monitors are not
     recommended to prevent SIDS but may be used to monitor
     other medical problems.
   • Discourage frequent checking of the infant. This will not
     prevent the occurrence of SIDS and frequent checking only
     tires the parents and creates an atmosphere of tension and
     anxiety.
   • Recommend public health nurse visit new mothers at least
     once or twice following discharge. Researchers found that
     American-Indian infants whose mothers received such visits
     were 80% less likely to die from SIDS than those who were
     never visited.
   • Refer parents to local SIDS programs and encourage consul-
     tation with healthcare provider if baby shows any signs of
     illness or behaviors that concern them. Can provide informa-
     tion and support for risk reduction and correction of treat-
     able problems. Healthcare providers will deal with illnesses,
     and so forth.

    creating the changes (e.g., seasonal bulletin boards, color
    changes, rearranging furniture, pictures).
•   Suggest activities, such as bird feeders/baths for bird-watch-
    ing, a garden in a window box/terrarium, or a fish bowl/
    aquarium, to stimulate observation as well as involvement
    and participation in activity, such as identification of birds,
    choice of seeds, and so forth.
•   Accept hostile expressions while limiting aggressive acting-
    out behavior. (Permission to express feelings of anger,
    hopelessness allows for beginning resolution. However,
    destructive behavior is counterproductive to self-esteem and
    problem solving.)
•   Involve occupational therapist as appropriate to help identify
    and procure assistive devices and/or gear specific activities to

NURSING PRIORITY NO.    1. To determine causative/contributing
factors:
• Develop therapeutic nurse-client relationship, initially accept-
  ing role of healer/guide as client desires.
• Provide opportunity for client to talk about illness, concerns,
  past history, emotional state, or other relevant information.
  Note body gestures, tone of voice, words chosen to express
  feelings/issues.
• Determine client’s motivation/desire for treatment.
• Note use of medications, other drug use (e.g., alcohol).
• Use testing as indicated, such as the State-Trait Anxiety
  Inventory (STAI) or the Affect Balance Scale, to provide
  measures of the client’s anxiety.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.    2. To evaluate energy field:
• Place client in sitting or supine position with legs/arms
  uncrossed. Place pillows or other supports to enhance
  comfort and relaxation.
• Center self physically and psychologically to quiet mind and
  turn attention to the healing intent.
• Move hands slowly over the client at level of 2 to 3 inches
  above skin to assess state of energy field and flow of energy
  within the system.
• Identify areas of imbalance or obstruction in the field (i.e.,
  areas of asymmetry; feelings of heat/cold, tingling, congestion
  or pressure).
NURSING PRIORITY NO.     3. To provide therapeutic intervention:
• Explain the process of Therapeutic Touch (TT) and answer
  questions as indicated to prevent unrealistic expectation.
  Fundamental focus of TT is on healing and wholeness, not
  curing signs/symptoms of disease.
• Discuss findings of evaluation with client.
• Assist client with exercises to promote “centering” and incr-
  ease potential to self-heal, enhance comfort, reduce anxiety.
• Perform unruffling process, keeping hands 2 to 3 inches from
  client’s body to dissipate impediments to free flow of energy
  within the system and between nurse and client.
• Focus on areas of disturbance identified, holding hands over
  or on skin, and/or place one hand in back of body with other
  hand in front, allows client’s body to pull/repattern energy
  as needed. At the same time, concentrate on the intent to help
  the client heal.
• Shorten duration of treatment as appropriate. Children and
  elderly individuals are generally more sensitive to therapeu-
  tic intervention.

   • Make coaching suggestions in a soft voice for enhancing feel-
     ings of relaxation (e.g., pleasant images/other visualizations,
     deep breathing).
   • Use hands-on massage/apply pressure to acupressure points
     as appropriate during process.
   • Pay attention to changes in energy sensations as session
     progresses. Stop when the energy field is symmetric and there
     is a change to feelings of peaceful calm.
   • Hold client’s feet for a few minutes at end of session to assist
     in “grounding” the body energy.
   • Provide client time for a period of peaceful rest following
     procedure.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Allow period of client dependency, as appropriate, for client
     to strengthen own inner resources.
   • Encourage ongoing practice of the therapeutic process.
   • Instruct in use of stress-reduction activities (e.g., center-
     ing/meditation, relaxation exercises) to promote harmony
     between mind-body-spirit.
   • Discuss importance of integrating techniques into daily activ-
     ity plan for sustaining/enhancing sense of well-being.
   • Have client practice each step and demonstrate the complete
     TT process following the session as client displays readiness to
     assume responsibilities for self-healing.
   • Promote attendance at a support group where members can
     help each other practice and learn the techniques of TT.
   • Refer to other resources as identified (e.g., psychotherapy,
     clergy, medical treatment of disease processes, hospice) for
     the individual to address total well-being/facilitate peaceful
     death.

   • Verbalize understanding of individual risk factors that
      contribute to possibility of falls and take steps to correct situ-
      ation(s).
   • Demonstrate behaviors, lifestyle changes to reduce risk factors
      and protect self from injury.
   • Modify environment as indicated to enhance safety.
   • Be free of injury.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To evaluate source/degree of risk:
   • Note age and sex (child, young adult, elderly women are at
      greater risk).
   • Evaluate developmental level, decision-making ability, level of
      cognition and competence. Infants, young children, and
      elderly are at greatest risk because of developmental issues
      and weakness. Individuals with physical injuries or cognitive
      impairments are also at risk for falls caused by immobility,
      use of assistive aids, environmental hazards, or inability to
      recognize danger.
   • Assess muscle strength, gross and fine motor coordination.
      Note individual’s general health status, determining what
      physical factors may affect safety, such as use of oxygen,
      chronic or debilitating conditions.
   • Evaluate client’s cognitive status. Affects ability to perceive
      own limitations and risk for falling.
18 N U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E


• Assess mood, coping abilities, personality styles. Individual’s
                                                                        Falls, risk for
  temperament, typical behavior, stressors and level of self-
  esteem can affect attitude toward safety issues, resulting in
  carelessness or increased risk-taking without consideration
  of consequences.
• Ascertain knowledge of safety needs/injury prevention
  and motivation to prevent injury. Client/caregivers may
  not be aware of proper precautions or may not have the
  knowledge, desire, or resources to attend to safety issues in all
  settings.
• Note socioeconomic status/availability and use of resources in
  other circumstances. Can affect current coping abilities.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assist client/caregiver to reduce or
correct individual risk factors:
• Provide information regarding client’s disease/condition(s)
  that may result in increased risk of falls.
• Identify needed interventions and safety devices to promote
  safe environment and individual safety.
• Review consequences of previously determined risk factors
  (e.g., falls caused by failure to make provisions for impair-
  ments caused by physical, cognitive, or environmental
  factors).
• Review medication regimen and how it affects client. Instruct
  in monitoring of effects/side effects. Use of pain medications
  may contribute to weakness and confusion; multiple medica-
  tions and combinations of medications affecting blood pres-
  sure or cardiac function may contribute to dizziness or loss
  of balance.
• Discuss importance of monitoring conditions that contribute
  to occurrence of injury (e.g., fatigue, objects that block traffic
  patterns, lack of sufficient light, attempting tasks that are too
  difficult for present level of functioning, lack of ability to
  contact someone when help is needed).
• Determine caregiver’s expectations of children, cognitively
  impaired and/or elderly family members and compare with
  actual abilities. Reality of client’s abilities and needs may be
  different than perception or desires of caregivers.
• Discuss need for and sources of supervision (e.g., babysitters,
  before- and after-school programs, elderly day care, personal
  companions, etc.).
• Plan for home visit when appropriate. Determine that home
  safety issues are addressed, including supervision, access to
  emergency assistance, and client’s ability to manage self care
  in the home. May be needed to adequately determine client’s
  needs and available resources.
• Refer to physical or occupational therapist as appropriate.

   • Promote education geared to increasing individual’s aware-
     ness of safety measures and available resources.
   • Promote community awareness about the problems of design
     of buildings, equipment, transportation, and workplace acci-
     dents that contribute to falls.
   • Connect client/family with community resources, neighbors,

     ings expressed? Freely? Who talks to whom? Who makes
     decisions? For whom? Who visits? When? What is the interac-
     tion between family members? (Not only identifies weak-
     ness/areas of concern to be addressed but also strengths that
     can be used for resolution of problem.)
   • Assess boundaries of family members. Do members share
     family identity and have little sense of individuality? Do they
     seem emotionally distant, not connected with one another?
   • Ascertain role expectations of family members. Who is the ill
     member (e.g., nurturer, provider)? How does the illness affect
     the roles of others?
   • Determine “Family Rules.” For example, adult concerns
     (finances, illness, etc.) are kept from the children.
   • Identify parenting skills and expectations.
   • Note energy direction. Are efforts at resolution/problem solv-
     ing purposeful or scattered?

Criteria—Client Will:
• Express feelings freely and appropriately.
• Verbalize understanding of desire for enhanced family
  dynamics.
• Demonstrate individual involvement in problem solving to
  improve family communications.
• Acknowledge awareness of boundaries of family members.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 1. To determine current status of
family:
• Assess family composition: parent(s), children, male/female,
  extended family. Many family forms exist in society today,
  such as biological, nuclear, single-parent, stepfamily,
  communal, and same-sex couple or family. A better way to
  determine a family may be to determine the attribute of
  affection, strong emotional ties, a sense of belonging, and
  durability of membership.
• Note participating members of family: parent(s), children,
  male/female, extended family. Identifies members of family
  who need to be directly involved and taken into considera-
  tion in developing plan of care to improve family func-
  tioning.
• Note stage of family development (e.g., single, young adult,
  newly married, family with young children, family with
  adolescents, grown children, later life). Tasks may vary
  greatly among cultural groups, and this information
  provides a framework for developing plan to enhance family
  processes.
• Observe patterns of communication in the family. Are feel-
  ings expressed: Freely? Who talks to whom? Who makes
  decisions? For Whom? Who visits? When? What is the inter-
  action between family members? Not only identifies weak-
  ness/areas of concern to be addressed but also strengths
  that can be used for planning improvement in family
  communication.
• Assess boundaries of family members. Do members
  share family identity and have little sense of individuality? Do
  they seem emotionally connected with one another?
  Individuals need to respect one another and boundaries need
  to be clear so family members are free to be responsible for
  themselves.
• Identify ‘family rules’ that are accepted in the family. Families
  interact in certain ways over time and develop patterns of
  behavior that are accepted as the way ‘we behave’ in this
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                        229


     family. ‘Functional families’ rules are constructive and
     promote the needs of all family members.
   • Note energy direction. Efforts at problem solving and resolu-
     tion of different opinions may be purposeful or may be scat-
     tered and ineffective.
   • Determine cultural and/or religious factors influencing family
     interactions. Expectations related to socioeconomic beliefs
     may be different in various cultures, for instance, traditional
     views of marriage and family life may be strongly influenced
     by Roman Catholicism in Italian-American and Latino-
     American families. In some cultures the father is considered
     the authority figure and the mother is the homemaker. These
     beliefs may be functional or dysfunctional in any given
     family and may even change with stressors/circumstances
     (e.g., financial, loss/gain of a family member, personal
     growth).
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.       2. To assist the family to improve inter-
   actions:
   • Establish nurse-family relationship. Promotes a warm, caring
     atmosphere in which family members can share thoughts,
     ideas, and feelings openly and nonjudgmentally.
   • Acknowledge realities, and possible difficulties, of individual
     situation. Reinforces that some degree of conflict is to be
     expected in family interactions that can be used to promote
     growth.
   • Stress importance of continuous, open dialogue between
     family members. Facilitates ongoing expression of open,
     honest feelings and opinions and effective problem
     solving.
   • Assist family to identify and encourage use of previously
     successful coping behaviors. Promotes recognition of previ-
     ous successes and confidence in own abilities to learn and
     improve family interactions.
   • Acknowledge differences among family members with open
     dialogue about how these differences have occurred. Conveys
     an acceptance of these differences among individuals and
     helps to look at how they can be used to strengthen the
     family.
   • Identify effective parenting skills already being used and
     suggest new ways of handling difficult behaviors. Allows indi-
     vidual family members to realize that some of what has been
     done already has been helpful and encourages them to learn
     new skills to manage family interactions in a more effective
     manner.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        3. To promote optimum well-being:
   • Discuss and encourage use and participation in stress-
30 N U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E


    management techniques. Relaxation exercises, visualiza-
                                                                        Family Processes, readiness for enhanced
    tion, and similar skills can be useful for promoting reduction
    of anxiety and ability to manage stress that occurs in their
    lives.
•   Encourage participation in learning role-reversal activities.
    Helps individuals to gain insight and understanding of other
    person’s feelings and point of view.
•   Involve family members in setting goals and planning
    for the future. When individuals are involved in the
    decision making, they are more committed to carrying
    through a plan to enhance family interactions as life
    goes on.
•   Provide educational materials and information. Enhances
    learning to assist in developing positive relationships among
    family members.
•   Assist family members to identify situations that may create
    problems and lead to fear/anxiety. Thinking ahead can help
    individuals anticipate helpful actions to prevent conflict and
    untoward consequences.
•   Refer to classes/support groups as appropriate. Family
    Effectiveness, self-help, psychology, religious affiliations can
    provide new information to assist family members to learn
    and apply to enhancing family interactions.

• Identify basis of fatigue and individual areas of control.
• Perform ADLs and participate in desired activities at level of
  ability.
• Participate in recommended treatment program.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.         1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Review medication regimen/use (e.g., beta blockers with
  fatigue as a side effect, cancer chemotherapy).
• Identify presence of physical and/or psychological disease
  states (e.g., multiple sclerosis, lupus, chronic pain, hepatitis,
  AIDS, major depressive disorder, anxiety states).
• Note stage of disease process, nutrition state, fluid balance.
• Determine ability to participate in activities/level of mobility.
• Assess presence/degree of sleep disturbances.
• Note lifestyle changes, expanded responsibilities/demands of
  others, job-related conflicts.
• Assess psychologic and personality factors that may affect
  reports of fatigue level.
• Note client’s belief about what is causing the fatigue and what
  relieves it.
• Evaluate aspect of “learned helplessness” that may be mani-
  fested by giving up. Can perpetuate a cycle of fatigue,
  impaired functioning, and increased anxiety and fatigue.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To determine degree of fatigue/
impact on life:
• Use a scale, such as Piper Fatigue Self-Report or Nail’s Gene-
  ral Fatigue Scale, as appropriate. Can help determine mani-
  festation, intensity, duration, and emotional meaning of
  fatigue.
• Note daily energy patterns (i.e., peaks/valleys). Helpful in
  determining pattern/timing of activity.
• Discuss lifestyle changes/limitations imposed by fatigue state.
• Interview parent/care provider regarding specific changes
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                        233


     observed in child/elder. (These individuals may not be
     able to verbalize feelings or relate meaningful information.)
   • Review availability and current use of support systems/
     resources.
   • Evaluate need for individual assistance/assistive devices.
   • Measure physiologic response to activity (e.g., changes in
     blood pressure or heart/respiratory rate).
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        3. To assist client to cope with fatigue
   and manage within individual limits of ability:
   • Accept reality of client reports of fatigue and do not underes-
     timate effect on quality of life the client experiences (e.g.,
     clients with MS are prone to more frequent/severe fatigue
     following minimal energy expenditure and require longer
     recovery period; post-polio clients often display a cumulative
     effect if they fail to pace themselves and rest when early signs
     of fatigue are encountered).
   • Establish realistic activity goals with client. Enhances
     commitment to promoting optimal outcomes.
   • Plan care to allow individually adequate rest periods.
     Schedule activities for periods when client has the most
     energy to maximize participation.
   • Involve client/SO(s) in schedule planning.
   • Encourage client to do whatever possible (e.g., self-care, sit up
     in chair, walk). Increase activity level as tolerated.
   • Instruct in methods to conserve energy (e.g., sit instead of
     stand during activities/shower; plan steps of activity before
     beginning so that all needed materials are at hand).
   • Assist with self-care needs; keep bed in low position and
     travelways clear of furniture, assist with ambulation as indi-
     cated.
   • Provide environment conducive to relief of fatigue. Tempera-
     ture and level of humidity are known to affect exhaustion
     (especially in clients with MS).
   • Provide diversional activities. Avoid overstimulation/under-
     stimulation (cognitive and sensory). Impaired concentration
     can limit ability to block competing stimuli/distractions.
   • Discuss routines to promote restful sleep. (Refer to ND Sleep
     Pattern, disturbed.)

• Demonstrate understanding through use of effective coping
  behaviors (e.g., problem solving) and resources.
• Display appropriate range of feelings and lessened fear.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.     1. To assess degree of fear and reality of
threat perceived by the client:
• Ascertain client/SO(s) perception of what is occurring and
  how this affects life.
• Note degree of incapacitation (e.g., “frozen with fear,” inabil-
  ity to engage in necessary activities).
• Compare verbal/nonverbal responses to note congruencies or
  misperceptions of situation.
• Be alert to signs of denial/depression.
• Identify sensory deficits that may be present, such as hearing
  impairment. Affects sensory reception and interpretation.
• Note degree of concentration, focus of attention.
• Investigate client’s reports of subjective experiences (may be
  delusions/hallucinations).

     a similarly fearful situation. Provides a role model, and client
     is more likely to believe others who have had similar experi-
     ence(s).
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To assist client in learning to use own
   responses for problem solving:
   • Acknowledge usefulness of fear for taking care of self.
   • Identify client’s responsibility for the solutions. (Reinforce
     that the nurse will be available for help.) Enhances sense of
     control.
   • Determine internal/external resources for help (e.g., aware-
     ness/use of effective coping skills in the past; SOs who are
     available for support).
   • Explain procedures within level of client’s ability to under-
     stand and handle. (Be aware of how much information client
     wants to prevent confusion/overload.)

       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                           239


   Desired Outcome/Evaluation
   Criteria—Client Will:
   • Maintain fluid volume at a functional level as indicated by
     adequate urinary output, stable vital signs, moist mucous
     membranes, good skin turgor.
   • Demonstrate behaviors to monitor fluid balance.
   • Be free of thirst.
   • Be free of evidence of fluid overload (e.g., absence of edema
     and adventitious lung sounds).
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.           1. To determine potential for fluid
   imbalance and ways that client is managing:
   • Note presence of medical diagnoses with potential for fluid
     imbalance: (1) diagnoses/disease processes that may lead
     to deficits (e.g., diuretic therapy, hyperglycemia; ulcera-
     tive colitis, COPD, burns, cirrhosis of the liver, vomiting, diar-
     rhea, hemorrhage; hot/humid climate, prolonged exercise;
     getting overheated/fever; diuretic effect of caffeine/alcohol);
     or (2) fluid excess (e.g., renal failure, cardiac failure, stroke,
     cerebral lesions, renal/adrenal insufficiency, psychogenic
     polydipsia, acute stress, surgical/anesthetic procedures,
     excessive or rapid infusion of IV fluids). Body fluid balance
     is regulated by intake (food and fluid), output (kidney,
     gastrointestinal tract, skin, and lungs), and regulatory
     hormonal mechanisms. Balance is maintained within
     relatively narrow margin and can be easily disrupted by
     multiple factors.
   • Determine potential effects of age and developmental stage.
     Elderly individuals have less body water than younger adults,
     decreased thirst response, and reduced effectiveness of
     compensatory mechanisms (e.g., kidneys are less efficient in
     conserving sodium and water). Infants and children have a
     relatively higher percentage of total body water and meta-
     bolic rate and are sometimes less able than adults to control
     their fluid intake.
   • Evaluate environmental factors that could impact fluid
     balance. Persons with impaired mobility, diminished vision,
     or confined to bed cannot as easily meet their own needs and
     may be reluctant to ask for assistance. Persons whose work
     environment is restrictive or outside may also have greater
     challenges in meeting fluid needs.
   • Assess vital signs (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, heart
     rate), skin/mucous membrane moisture, and urine output.
     Weigh as indicated. Predictors of fluid balance that should be
     in client’s usual range in a healthy state.

NURSING PRIORITY NO.     2. To prevent occurrence of imbalance:
                                                                       Fluid Balance, readiness for enhanced
• Monitor I/O (e.g., frequency of voids/diaper changes) as
  appropriate, being aware of insensible losses (e.g., hot envi-
  ronment, use of oxygen/permanent tracheostomy) and
  “hidden sources” of intake (e.g., foods high in water content)
  to ensure accurate picture of fluid status.
• Weigh client and compare with recent weight history.
  Provides baseline for future monitoring.
• Establish and review with client individual fluid needs/
  replacement schedule. Active participation in planning for
  own needs enhances likelihood of adhering to plan.
• Encourage regular oral intake (e.g., fluids between meals,
  additional fluids during hot weather or when exercising) to
  maximize intake and maintain fluid balance.
• Distribute fluids over 24-hour period in presence of fluid
  restriction. Prevents peaks/valleys in fluid level and associ-
  ated thirst.
• Administer/discuss judicious use of medications as indicated
  (e.g., antiemetics, antidiarrheals, antipyretics, and diuretics).
  Medications may be indicated to prevent fluid imbalance if
  individual becomes sick.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.     3. To promote optimum wellness:
• Discuss client’s individual conditions/factors that could cause
  occurrence of fluid imbalance as individually appropriate
  (such as prevention of hyperglycemic episodes) so that
  client/SO can take corrective action.
• Identify and instruct in ways to meet specific fluid needs (e.g.,
  client could carry water bottle when going to sports events or
  measure specific 24-hour fluid portions if restrictions apply)
  to manage fluid intake over time.
• Recommend restriction of caffeine, alcohol as indicated.
  Prevents untoward diuretic effect and possible dehydra-
  tion.
• Instruct client/SO(s) in how to measure and record I/O if
  needed for home management. Provides means of monitor-
  ing status and adjusting therapy to meet changing needs.
• Establish regular schedule for weighing. To help monitor
  changes in fluid status.
• Identify actions (if any) client may take to correct imbalance.
  Encourages responsibility for self-care.
• Review any dietary needs/restrictions and safe substitutes for
  salt as appropriate. Helps prevent fluid retention/edema
  formation.
• Review/instruct in medication regimen and administration
  and discuss potential for interactions/side effects that could
  disrupt fluid balance.

• Identify and express feelings (e.g., sadness, guilt, fear)
  freely/effectively.
• Acknowledge impact/effect of the grieving process (e.g., phys-
  ical problems of eating, sleeping) and seek appropriate help.
• Look toward/plan for future, one day at a time.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.      1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Determine client’s perception of anticipated loss and meaning
  to him or her. “What are your concerns?” “What are your
  fears? Your greatest fear?” “How do you see this affecting
  you/your lifestyle?”
• Ascertain response of family/SO(s) to client’s situation/
  concerns.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.     2. To determine current response to
anticipated loss:
• Note emotional responses, such as withdrawal, angry behav-
  ior, crying.
• Observe client’s body language and check out meaning with
  the client. Note congruency with verbalizations.
• Note cultural factors/expectations that may impact client’s
  responses to assess how the client is responding to the situa-
  tion.
• Identify problems with eating, activity level, sexual desire, role
  performance (e.g., work, parenting).
• Note family communication/interaction patterns.

   • Determine use/availability of community resources/support
     groups.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To assist client to deal with situation:
   • Provide open environment and trusting relationship.
     Promotes a free discussion of feelings and concerns.
   • Use therapeutic communication skills of Active-listening,
     silence, acknowledgment. Respect client desire/request not to
     talk.
   • Provide puppets or play therapy for toddlers/young children.
     (May help express grief and deal with loss.)
   • Permit appropriate expressions of anger, fear. Note hostility
     toward/feelings of abandonment by spiritual power. (Refer to
     appropriate NDs, e.g., Spiritual Distress.)
   • Provide information about normalcy of individual grief
     reaction.
   • Be honest when answering questions, providing information.
     Enhances sense of trust and nurse-client relationship.
   • Provide assurance to child that cause for situation is not
     client’s own doing, bearing in mind age and developmental
     level. May lessen sense of guilt and affirm there is no need to
     assign blame to any family member.
   • Provide hope within parameters of individual situation. Do
     not give false reassurance.
   • Review past life experiences/previous loss(es), role changes,
     and coping skills, noting strengths/successes. Useful in deal-
     ing with current situation and problem solving existing
     needs.
   • Discuss control issues, such as what is in the power of the
     individual to change and what is beyond control. Recognition
     of these factors helps client focus energy for maximal bene-
     fit/outcome.
   • Incorporate family/SO(s) in problem solving. Encourages
     family to support/assist client to deal with situation while
     meeting needs of family members.
   • Determine client’s status and role in family (e.g., parent,
     sibling, child, and address loss of family member role).
   • Instruct in use of visualization and relaxation techniques.
   • Use sedatives/tranquilizers with caution. May retard passage
     through the grief process.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Give information that feelings are OK and are to be expressed
     appropriately. Expression of feelings can facilitate the
     grieving process, but destructive behavior can be damaging.
   • Encourage continuation of usual activities/schedule and
     involvement in appropriate exercise program.
   • Identify/promote family and social support systems.

   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.            1. To assess causative/contributing
   factors:
   • Identify underlying cause (e.g., excessive heat production
     such as hyperthyroid state, malignant hyperpyrexia; impaired
     heat dissipation such as heatstroke, dehydration; autonomic
     dysfunction as occurs with spinal cord transection; hypothal-
     amic dysfunction, such as CNS infection, brain lesions, drug
     overdose; infection).
   • Note chronological and developmental age of client. Children
     are more susceptible to heatstroke, elderly or impaired indi-
     viduals may not be able to recognize and/or act on symptoms
     of hyperthermia.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To evaluate effects/degree of hyper-
   thermia:
   • Monitor core temperature. Note: Rectal and tympanic
     temperatures most closely approximate core temperature;
     however, abdominal temperature monitoring may be done in
     the premature neonate.
   • Assess neurologic response, noting level of consciousness and
     orientation, reaction to stimuli, reaction of pupils, presence of
     posturing or seizures.
   • Monitor BP and invasive hemodynamic parameters if avail-
     able (e.g., mean arterial pressure—MAP, CVP, PAP, PCWP).
     Central hypertension or peripheral/postural hypotension
     can occur.
   • Monitor heart rate and rhythm. Dysrhythmias and ECG
     changes are common due to electrolyte imbalance, dehydra-
     tion, specific action of catecholamines, and direct effects of
     hyperthermia on blood and cardiac tissue.
   • Monitor respirations. Hyperventilation may initially be
     present, but ventilatory effort may eventually be impaired
     by seizures, hypermetabolic state (shock and acidosis).
   • Auscultate breath sounds, noting adventitious sounds such as
     crackles (rales).
   • Monitor/record all sources of fluid loss such as urine (oliguria
     and/or renal failure may occur due to hypotension, dehydra-
     tion, shock, and tissue necrosis), vomiting and diarrhea,
     wounds/fistulas, and insensible losses (potentiates fluid and
     electrolyte losses).
   • Note presence/absence of sweating as body attempts to
     increase heat loss by evaporation, conduction, and diffusion.
     Evaporation is decreased by environmental factors of high
     humidity and high ambient temperature as well as body
     factors producing loss of ability to sweat or sweat gland

• Monitor laboratory studies such as ABGs, electrolytes, cardiac
  and liver enzymes (may reveal tissue degeneration); glucose;
  urinalysis (myoglobinuria, proteinuria, and hemoglobinuria
  can occur as products of tissue necrosis); and coagulation
  profile (for presence of disseminated intravascular coagula-
  tion—DIC).
NURSING PRIORITY NO.      3. To assist with measures to reduce
body temperature/restore normal body/organ function:
• Administer antipyretics, orally/rectally (e.g., aspirin, aceta-
  minophen), as ordered.
• Promote surface cooling by means of undressing (heat loss by
  radiation and conduction); cool environment and/or fans
  (heat loss by convection); cool/tepid sponge baths or immer-
  sion (heat loss by evaporation and conduction); local ice
  packs, especially in groin and axillae (areas of high blood
  flow); and/or use of hypothermia blanket. (Note: In pediatric
  clients, tepid water is preferred. Alcohol sponges are no
  longer used because they can increase peripheral vascular
  constriction and CNS depression; cold-water sponges/
  immersion can increase shivering, producing heat.) In pres-
  ence of malignant hyperthermia, lavage of body cavities with
  cold water may be used to promote core cooling.
• Administer medications (e.g., chlorpromazine or diazepam)
  as ordered to control shivering and seizures.
• Wrap extremities with bath towels when hypothermia blanket
  is used to minimize shivering.
• Turn off hypothermia blanket when core temperature is
  within 1° to 3° of desired temperature to allow for downward
  drift.
• Promote client safety (e.g., maintain patent airway, padded
  siderails, skin protection from cold such as when hypother-
  mia blanket is used, observation of equipment safety
  measures).
• Provide supplemental oxygen to offset increased oxygen
  demands and consumption.
• Administer medications as indicated to treat underlying
  cause, such as antibiotics (for infection), dantrolene (for
  malignant hyperthermia), beta blockers (for thyroid storm).
• Administer replacement fluids and electrolytes to support
  circulating volume and tissue perfusion.
• Maintain bedrest to reduce metabolic demands/oxygen
  consumption.
• Provide high-calorie diet, tube feedings, or parenteral nutri-
  tion to meet increased metabolic demands.

   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Review specific cause such as underlying disease process
     (thyroid storm); environmental factors (heatstroke); reaction
     to anesthesia (malignant hyperthermia).
   • Identify those factors that client can control (if any), such as
     correction of underlying disease process (e.g., thyroid control
     medication); ways to protect oneself from excessive exposure
     to environmental heat (e.g., proper clothing, restriction of
     activity, scheduling outings during cooler part of day); and
     understanding of family traits (e.g., malignant hyperthermia
     reaction to anesthesia is often familial).
   • Discuss importance of adequate fluid intake to prevent dehy-
     dration.
   • Review signs/symptoms of hyperthermia (e.g., flushed skin,
     increased body temperature, increased respiratory/heart
     rate). Indicates need for prompt intervention.
   • Recommend avoidance of hot tubs/saunas as appropriate
     (e.g., clients with cardiac conditions, pregnancy that may
     affect fetal development or increase cardiac workload).

   • Verbalize understanding of specific interventions to prevent
     hypothermia.
   • Demonstrate behaviors to monitor and promote normo-
     thermia.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.            1. To assess causative/contributing
   factors:
   • Note underlying cause (e.g., exposure to cold weather, cold-
     water immersion, preparation for surgery, open wounds/
     exposed viscera, multiple rapid transfusions of banked blood,
     treatment for hyperthermia).
   • Note contributing factors: age of client (e.g., premature
     neonate, child, elderly person); concurrent/coexisting medical
     problems (e.g., brainstem injury, near-drowning, sepsis,
     hypothyroidism, alcohol intoxication); nutrition status; living
     condition/relationship status (e.g., aged/cognitive impaired
     client living alone).
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        2. To prevent further decrease in body
   temperature:
   • Remove wet clothing. Prevent pooling of antiseptic/irrigating
     solutions under client in operating room.
   • Wrap in warm blankets, extra clothing; cover skin areas
     outside of operative field.
   • Avoid use of heat lamps or hot water bottles. (Surface
     rewarming can result in rewarming shock due to surface
     vasodilation.)
   • Provide warm liquids if client can swallow.
   • Warm blood transfusions as appropriate.
   • Prevent drafts in room.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        3. To evaluate effects of hypothermia:
   • Measure core temperature with low register thermometer
     (measuring below 94°F/34°C).
   • Assess respiratory effort (rate and tidal volume are reduced
     when metabolic rate decreases and respiratory acidosis
     occurs).
   • Auscultate lungs, noting adventitious sounds (pulmonary
     edema, respiratory infection, and pulmonary embolus are
     possible complications of hypothermia).
   • Monitor heart rate and rhythm. Cold stress reduces pace-
     maker function, and bradycardia (unresponsive to atropine),
     atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular blocks, and ventricular
     tachycardia can occur. Ventricular fibrillation occurs most
     frequently when core temperature is 82°F/28°C or below.
   • Monitor BP, noting hypotension. Can occur due to vasocon-

  striction, and shunting of fluids as a result of cold injury
                                                                      Hypothermia
  effect on capillary permeability.
• Measure urine output (oliguria/renal failure can occur due to
  low flow state and/or following hypothermic osmotic diure-
  sis).
• Note CNS effects (e.g., mood changes, sluggish thinking,
  amnesia, complete obtundation); and peripheral CNS effects
  (e.g., paralysis—87.7°F/31°C, dilated pupils—below 86°F/
  30°C, flat EEG—68°F/20°C).
• Monitor laboratory studies such as ABGs (respiratory and
  metabolic acidosis); electrolytes; CBC (increased hematocrit,
  decreased white blood cell count); cardiac enzymes (myocar-
  dial infarct may occur owing to electrolyte imbalance, cold
  stress catecholamine release, hypoxia, or acidosis); coagula-
  tion profile; glucose; pharmacological profile (for possible
  cumulative drug effects).
NURSING PRIORITY NO.       4. To restore normal body tempera-
ture/organ function:
• Assist with measures to normalize core temperature, such as
  warmed IV solutions and warm solution lavage of body cavi-
  ties (gastric, peritoneal, bladder) or cardiopulmonary bypass
  if indicated.
• Rewarm no faster than 1° to 2°/h to avoid sudden vasodila-
  tion, increased metabolic demands on heart, and hypoten-
  sion (rewarming shock).
• Assist with surface warming by means of warmed blankets,
  warm environment/radiant heater, electronic warming
  devices. Cover head/neck and thorax, leaving extremities
  uncovered as appropriate to maintain peripheral vasocon-
  striction. Note: Do not institute surface rewarming prior to
  core rewarming in severe hypothermia (causes after drop of
  temperature by shunting cold blood back to heart in addi-
  tion to rewarming shock as a result of surface vasodilation).
• Protect skin/tissues by repositioning, applying lotion/lubri-
  cants, and avoiding direct contact with heating appliance/
  blanket. (Impaired circulation can result in severe tissue
  damage.)
• Keep client quiet; handle gently to reduce potential for fibril-
  lation in cold heart.
• Provide CPR as necessary, with compressions initially at one-
  half normal heart rate (severe hypothermia causes slowed
  conduction, and cold heart may be unresponsive to medica-
  tions, pacing, and defibrillation).
• Maintain patent airway. Assist with intubation if indicated.
• Provide heated, humidified oxygen when used.
• Turn off warming blanket when temperature is within 1° to 3°
  of desired temperature to avoid hyperthermia situation.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                       293


   • Administer IV fluids with caution to prevent overload as the
     vascular bed expands (cold heart is slow to compensate for
     increased volume).
   • Avoid vigorous drug therapy (as rewarming occurs, organ
     function returns, correcting endocrine abnormalities, and
     tissues become more receptive to the effects of drugs previ-
     ously administered). Note: Iloprost IV may help control
     blood viscosity—enhancing circulation and reducing risk of
     gangrene.
   • Immerse hands/feet in warm water/apply warm soaks
     once body temperature is stabilized. Place sterile cotton
     between digits and wrap hands/feet with a bulky gauze
     wrap.
   • Perform range-of-motion exercises, provide support hose,
     reposition, do coughing/deep-breathing exercises, avoid
     restrictive clothing/restraints to reduce circulatory stasis.
   • Provide well-balanced, high-calorie diet/feedings to replenish
     glycogen stores and nutritional balance.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 5. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Inform client/SO(s) of procedures being used to rewarm
     client.
   • Review specific cause of hypothermia.
   • Discuss signs/symptoms of early hypothermia (e.g., changes
     in mentation, somnolence, impaired coordination, slurred
     speech) to facilitate recognition of problem and timely inter-
     vention.
   • Identify factors that client can control (if any), such as protec-
     tion from environment, potential risk for future hypersensi-
     tivity to cold, and so forth.

   Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
   Criteria—Infant Will:
   • Exhibit organized behaviors that allow the achievement of
      optimal potential for growth and development as evidenced
      by modulation of physiologic, motor, state, and attentional-
      interactive functioning.
   Parent/Caregiver Will:
   • Recognize individual infant cues.
   • Identify appropriate responses (including environmental
      modifications) to infant’s cues.
   • Verbalize readiness to assume caregiving independently.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.             1. To assess causative/contributing
   factors:
   • Determine infant’s chronological and developmental age;
      note length of gestation.
   • Observe for cues suggesting presence of situations that may
      result in pain/discomfort.
   • Determine adequacy of physiological support.
96 N U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E


• Evaluate level/appropriateness of environmental stimuli.
                                                                    Infant Behavior, disorganized
• Ascertain parents’ understanding of infant’s needs/abilities.
• Listen to parent’s concerns about their capabilities to meet
  infant’s needs.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assist parents in providing co-
regulation to the infant:
• Provide a calm, nurturant physical and emotional environ-
  ment.
• Encourage parents to hold infant, including skin-to-skin
  contact as appropriate.
• Model gentle handling of baby and appropriate responses to
  infant behavior. Provides cues to parent.
• Support and encourage parents to be with infant and partici-
  pate actively in all aspects of care. Situation may be over-
  whelming and support may enhance coping.
• Discuss infant growth/development, pointing out current
  status and progressive expectations as appropriate. Augments
  parents’ knowledge of co-regulation.
• Incorporate the parents’ observations and suggestions into
  plan of care. Demonstrates valuing of parents’ input and
  encourages continued involvement.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To deliver cares within the infant’s
stress threshold:
• Provide a consistent caregiver. Facilitates recognition of
  infant cues/changes in behavior.
• Identify infant’s individual self-regulatory behaviors, e.g.,
  sucking, mouthing; grasp, hand-to-mouth, face behaviors;
  foot clasp, brace; limb flexion, trunk tuck; boundary seeking.
• Support hands to mouth and face; offer pacifier or non-
  nutritive sucking at the breast with gavage feedings. Provides
  opportunities for infant to suck.
• Avoid aversive oral stimulation, such as routine oral suction-
  ing; suction ET tube only when clinically indicated.
• Use oxy-hood large enough to cover the infant’s chest so arms
  will be inside the hood. Allows for hand-to-mouth activities
  during this therapy.
• Provide opportunities for infant to grasp.
• Provide boundaries and/or containment during all activities.
  Use swaddling, nesting, bunting, caregiver’s hands as indi-
  cated.
• Allow adequate time/opportunities to hold infant. Handle
  infant very gently, move infant smoothly, slowly and
  contained, avoiding sudden/abrupt movements.
• Maintain normal alignment, position infant with limbs softly
  flexed, shoulders and hips adducted slightly. Use appropriate-
  sized diapers.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                     297


   • Evaluate chest for adequate expansion, placing rolls under
     trunk if prone position indicated.
   • Avoid restraints, including at IV sites. If IV board is necessary,
     secure to limb positioned in normal alignment.
   • Provide a sheepskin, egg-crate mattress, water bed, and/or gel
     pillow/mattress for infant who does not tolerate frequent
     position changes. Minimizes tissue pressure, lessens risk of
     tissue injury.
   • Visually assess color, respirations, activity, invasive lines
     without disturbing infant. Assess with “hands on” every 4
     hours as indicated and prn. Allows for undisturbed rest/quiet
     periods.
   • Schedule daily activities, time for rest, and organization of
     sleep/wake states to maximize tolerance of infant. Defer
     routine care when infant in quiet sleep.
   • Provide care with baby in sidelying position. Begin by talking
     softly to the baby, then placing hands in containing hold on
     baby, allows baby to prepare. Proceed with least-invasive
     manipulations first.
   • Respond promptly to infant’s agitation or restlessness.
     Provide “time out” when infant shows early cues of overstim-
     ulation. Comfort and support the infant after stressful inter-
     ventions.
   • Remain at infant’s bedside for several minutes after proce-
     dures/caregiving to monitor infant’s response and provide
     necessary support.
   • Administer analgesics as individually appropriate.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To modify the environment to
   provide appropriate stimulation:
   • Introduce stimulation as a single mode and assess individual
     tolerance.
   LIGHT/VISION
   • Reduce lighting perceived by infant; introduce diurnal light-
     ing (and activity) when infant achieves physiologic stability.
     (Day light levels of 20 to 30 candles and night light levels of
     less than 10 candles are suggested.) Change light levels gradu-
     ally to allow infant time to adjust.
   • Protect the infant’s eyes from bright illumination during
     examinations/procedures, as well as from indirect sources
     such as neighboring phototherapy treatments, to prevent reti-
     nal damage.
   • Deliver phototherapy (when required) with Biliblanket
     devices if available (alleviates need for eye patches).
   • Provide caregiver face (preferably parent’s) as visual stimulus
     when infant shows readiness (awake, attentive).

SOUND
• Identify sources of noise in environment and eliminate or
  reduce (e.g., speak in a low voice, reduce volume on
  alarms/telephones to safe but not excessive volume, pad metal
  trash can lids, open paper packages, such as IV tubing and
  suction catheters, slowly and at a distance from bedside,
  conduct rounds/report away from bedside, place soft/thick
  fabric such as blanket rolls and toys near infant’s head to
  absorb sound).
• Keep all incubator portholes closed, closing with two
  hands to avoid loud snap with closure and associated startle
  response.
• Do not play musical toys or tape players inside incubator.
• Avoid placing items on top of incubator; if necessary to do so,
  pad surface well.
• Conduct regular decibel checks of interior noise level in incu-
  bator (recommended not to exceed 60 dB).
• Provide auditory stimulation to console, support infant
  before and through handling or to reinforce restfulness.
OLFACTORY
• Be cautious in exposing infant to strong odors (such as alco-
  hol, Betadine, perfumes), as olfactory capability of the infant
  is very sensitive.
• Place a cloth or gauze pad scented with milk near the infant’s
  face during gavage feeding. Enhances association of milk with
  act of feeding/gastric fullness.
• Invite parents to leave a handkerchief that they have scented
  by wearing close to their body near infant. Strengthens infant
  recognition of parents.
VESTIBULAR
• Move and handle the infant slowly and gently. Do not restrict
  spontaneous movement.
• Provide vestibular stimulation to console, stabilize breath-
  ing/heart rate, or enhance growth. Use a water bed (with or
  without oscillation), a motorized/moving bed or cradle, or
  rocking in the arms of a caregiver.
GUSTATORY
• Dip pacifier in milk and offer to infant for sucking and tast-
  ing during gavage feeding.
TACTILE
• Maintain skin integrity and monitor closely. Limit frequency
  of invasive procedures.

   • Minimize use of chemicals on skin (e.g., alcohol, Betadine,
     solvents) and remove afterward with warm water because
     skin is very sensitive/fragile.
   • Limit use of tape and adhesives directly on skin. Use
     DuoDerm under tape to prevent dermal injury.
   • Touch infant with a firm containing touch, avoid light
     stroking. Provide a sheepskin, soft linen. Note: Tactile experi-
     ence is the primary sensory mode of the infant.
   • Encourage frequent parental holding of infant (including
     skin-to-skin). Supplement activity with extended family, staff,
     volunteers.

     nurse, home-care support, specialty organizations).
   • Determine sources for equipment/therapy needs.
   • Refer to support/therapy groups as indicated to provide role
     models, facilitate adjustment to new roles/responsibilities,
     and enhance coping.
   • Provide contact number as appropriate (e.g., primary nurse)
     to support adjustment to home setting.

[Changes in vital signs, cardiac rhythm]
Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
Criteria—Client Will:
• Demonstrate stable ICP as evidenced by normalization of
  pressure waveforms/response to stimuli.
• Display improved neurologic signs.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.         1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Determine factors related to individual situation (e.g., cause
  of coma)
• Monitor/document changes in ICP waveform and correspon-
  ding event (e.g., suctioning, position change, monitor alarms,
  family visit) to alter care appropriately.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.    2. To note degree of impairment:
• Assess eye opening and position/movement, pupils (size,
  shape, equality, light reactivity), and consciousness/mental
  status.
• Note purposeful and nonpurposeful motor response (postur-
  ing, etc.), comparing right/left sides.
• Test for presence/absence of reflexes (e.g., blink, cough, gag,
  Babinski’s reflex), nuchal rigidity.
• Monitor vital signs and cardiac rhythm before/during/after
  activity. Helps determine parameters for “safe” activity.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.          3. To minimize/correct causative
factors/maximize perfusion:
• Elevate head of bed (HOB) 15 to 45 degrees (30 degrees for
  child), as individually appropriate.
• Maintain head/neck in neutral position, support with small
  towel rolls or pillows to maximize venous return. Avoid plac-
  ing head on large pillow or causing hip flexion of 90 degrees
  or more.
• Decrease extraneous stimuli/provide comfort measures (e.g.,
  quiet environment, soft voice, tapes of familiar voices played
  through earphones, back massage, gentle touch as tolerated)
  to reduce CNS stimulation and promote relaxation.
• Limit painful procedures (e.g., venipunctures, redundant
  neurologic evaluations) to those that are absolutely necessary.
• Provide rest periods between care activities and limit duration
  of procedures. Lower lighting/noise level, schedule and limit
  activities to provide restful environment and promote regu-
  lar sleep patterns (i.e., day/night pattern).
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                      317


   • Limit/prevent activities that increase intrathoracic/abdominal
     pressures (e.g., coughing, vomiting, straining at stool).
     Avoid/limit use of restraints. These factors markedly increase
     ICP.
   • Suction with caution—only when needed—and limit to 2
     passes of 10 seconds each with negative pressure no more
     than 120 mm Hg. Suction just beyond end of endo/
     tracheal tube without touching tracheal wall or carina.
     Administer lidocaine intratracheally (reduces cough reflex),
     hyperoxygenate before suctioning as appropriate to minimize
     hypoxia.
   • Maintain patency of urinary drainage system to reduce risk of
     hypertension, increased ICP, associated dysreflexia if spinal
     cord injury is also present and spinal cord shock is past.
     (Refer to ND Autonomic Dysreflexia.)
   • Weigh as indicated. Calculate fluid balance every shift/daily
     to determine fluid needs/maintain hydration and prevent
     fluid overload.
   • Restrict fluid intake as necessary, administer IV fluids via
     pump/control device to prevent inadvertent fluid bolus or
     vascular overload.
   • Regulate environmental temperature/bed linens, use cooling
     blanket as indicated to decrease metabolic and O2 needs
     when fever present.
   • Investigate increased restlessness to determine causative
     factors and initiate corrective measures early or as indicated.
   • Provide appropriate safety measures/initiate treatment for
     seizures to prevent injury/increase of ICP/hypoxia.
   • Administer supplemental oxygen; hyperventilate as indicated
     when on mechanical ventilation. Monitor arterial blood gases
     (ABGs), particularly CO2 and Pao2 levels. Paco2 level of 28
     to 30 mm Hg decreases cerebral blood flow while maintain-
     ing adequate cerebral oxygenation, while a Pao2 of less than
     65 mm Hg may cause cerebral vascular dilation.
   • Administer medications (e.g., antihypertensives, diuretics,
     analgesics/sedatives, antipyretics, vasopressors, antiseizure
     drugs, neuromuscular blocking agents, and corticosteroids) as
     appropriate to maintain homeostasis.
   • Prepare client for surgery as indicated (e.g., evacuation of
     hematoma/space-occupying lesion) to reduce ICP/enhance
     circulation.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Discuss with caregivers specific situations (e.g., if client chok-
     ing or experiencing pain, needing to be repositioned, consti-
     pated, blocked urinary flow) and review appropriate
     interventions to prevent/limit episodic increases in ICP.

                                                                          Nausea
    foods). Dietary changes may be sufficient to decrease
    frequency of nausea.
•   Note systemic conditions that may result in nausea (e.g.,
    pregnancy, cancer treatment, myocardial infarction—
    MI, hepatitis, systemic infections, drug toxicity, presence
    of neurogenic causes-stimulation of the vestibular system,
    CNS trauma/tumor). Helpful in determining appro-
    priate interventions/need for treatment of underlying
    condition.
•   Identify situations that client perceives as anxiety inducing,
    threatening, or distasteful (e.g., “this is nauseating”). May be
    able to limit/control exposure to situations or take medica-
    tion prophylactically.
•   Note psychologic factors, including those that are culturally
    determined (e.g., eating certain foods considered repulsive in
    one’s own culture).
•   Determine if nausea is potentially self-limiting and/or mild
    (e.g., first trimester of pregnancy, 24-hour GI viral infection)
    or is severe and prolonged (e.g., cancer treatment, hypereme-
    sis gravidarum). Indicates degree of effect on fluid/elec-
    trolyte balance and nutritional status.
•   Check vital signs, especially for older clients, and note signs of
    dehydration. Nausea may occur in the presence of postural
    hypotension/fluid volume deficit.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.      2. To promote comfort and enhance
intake:
• Administer/monitor response to medications that prevent or
  relieve nausea. Provides sedative effect and prevents or
  relieves nausea. (Older clients are more prone to side effects
  [e.g., excessive sedation, extrapyramidal movements].)
• Have client try dry foods such as toast, crackers, dry cereal
  before arising when nausea occurs in the morning, or
  throughout the day as appropriate.
• Advise client to drink liquids before or after meals, instead of
  with meals.
• Provide diet and snacks with substitutions of preferred foods
  when available (including bland/noncaffeinated carbonated
  beverages, gelatin, sherbet) to reduce gastric acidity and
  improve nutrient intake. Include bland beverages, gelatin,
  sherbet. Avoid overly sweet, fried and fatty foods that may
  increase nausea/be more difficult to digest.
• Encourage client to eat small meals spaced throughout the
  day instead of large meals so stomach does not feel excessively
  full.

   • Provide clean, pleasant smelling, quiet environment. Avoid
     offending odors such as cooking smells, smoke, perfumes,
     mechanical emissions when possible as they may stimulate or
     worsen nausea.
   • Provide frequent oral care to cleanse mouth and minimize
     “bad tastes.”
   • Advise client to suck on ice cubes, tart or hard candies; drink
     cool, clear liquids, such as light-colored sodas. Can provide
     some fluid/nutrient intake.
   • Encourage deep, slow breathing to promote relaxation and
     refocus attention away from nausea.
   • Use distraction with music, chatting with family/friends,
     watching TV to limit dwelling on unpleasant sensation.
   • Administer antiemetic on regular schedule before/during and
     after administration of antineoplastic agents to prevent/
     control side effects of medication.
   • Investigate use of acupressure point therapy (e.g., elastic band
     worn around wrist with small, hard bump that presses against
     acupressure point). Some individuals with chronic nausea
     report this to be helpful and without sedative effect of
     medication.
   • Time chemotherapy doses for least interference with food
     intake.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Review individual factors causing nausea and ways to avoid
     problem. Provides necessary information for client to
     manage own care.
   • Instruct in proper use, side effects, and adverse reactions of
     antiemetic medications. Enhances client safety and effective
     management of condition.
   • Advise client to prepare and freeze meals in advance for days
     when nausea is severe or cooking is impossible.
   • Discuss potential complications and possible need for
     medical follow-up or alternative therapies. Timely recogni-
     tion and intervention may limit severity of complications
     (e.g., dehydration).
   • Review signs of dehydration and stress importance of replac-
     ing fluids and/or electrolytes (with products such as Gatorade
     or Pedialyte). Increases likelihood of preventing potentially
     serious complication.

NURSING PRIORITY NO.      1. To determine reason for alteration/
disregard of therapeutic regimen/instructions:
• Discuss with client/SO(s) their perception/understanding of
  the situation (illness/treatment).
• Listen to/Active-listen client’s complaints, comments.
• Note language spoken, read, and understood.
• Be aware of developmental level as well as chronological age
  of client.
• Assess level of anxiety, locus of control, sense of powerless-
  ness, and so forth.
• Note length of illness. (Clients tend to become passive and
  dependent in long-term, debilitating illnesses.)
• Clarify value system: cultural/religious values, health/illness
  beliefs of the client/SO(s).
• Determine social characteristics, demographic and educa-
  tional factors, as well as personality of the client.
• Verify psychologic meaning of the behavior (e.g., may be
  denial). Note issues of secondary gain—family dynamics,
  school/workplace issues, involvement in legal system may
  unconsciously affect client’s decision.
• Assess availability/use of support systems and resources.
• Be aware of nurses’/healthcare providers’ attitudes and behav-
  iors toward the client. (Do they have an investment in the
  client’s compliance/recovery? What is the behavior of the
  client and nurse when client is labeled “noncompliant”?)
  Some care providers may be enabling client whereas others’
  judgmental attitudes may impede treatment progress.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assist client/SO(s) to develop
strategies for dealing effectively with the situation:
• Develop therapeutic nurse-client relationship. Promotes
  trust, provides atmosphere in which client/SO(s) can freely
  express views/concerns.
• Explore client involvement in or lack of mutual goal setting.
  (Client will be more likely to follow through on goals he or
  she participated in developing.)
• Review treatment strategies. Identify which interventions in
  the plan of care are most important in meeting therapeutic
  goals and which are least amenable to compliance. Sets prior-
  ities and encourages problem solving areas of conflict.
• Contract with the client for participation in care. Enhances
  commitment to follow through.
• Encourage client to maintain self-care, providing for assis-
  tance when necessary. Accept client’s evaluation of own
  strengths/limitations while working with client to improve
  abilities.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                      345


   • Provide for continuity of care in and out of the hospital/care
     setting, including long-range plans. Supports trust, facilitates
     progress toward goals.
   • Provide information and help client to know where and how
     to find it on own. Promotes independence and encourages
     informed decision making.
   • Give information in manageable amounts, using verbal, writ-
     ten, and audiovisual modes at level of client’s ability.
     Facilitates learning.
   • Have client paraphrase instructions/information heard.
     Helps validate client’s understanding and reveals misconcep-
     tions.
   • Accept the client’s choice/point of view, even if it appears to
     be self-destructive. Avoid confrontation regarding beliefs to
     maintain open communication.
   • Establish graduated goals or modified regimen as necessary
     (e.g., client with COPD who smokes a pack of cigarettes a
     day may be willing to reduce that amount). May improve
     quality of life, encouraging progression to more advanced
     goals.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Stress importance of the client’s knowledge and understand-
     ing of the need for treatment/medication, as well as conse-
     quences of actions/choices.
   • Develop a system for self-monitoring to provide a sense of
     control and enable the client to follow own progress and
     assist with making choices.
   • Provide support systems to reinforce negotiated behaviors.
     Encourage client to continue positive behaviors, especially if
     client is beginning to see benefit.
   • Refer to counseling/therapy and/or other appropriate
     resources.
   • Refer to NDs Coping, ineffective; Coping, family: compro-
     mised; Knowledge, deficient (specify); Anxiety.

Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 1. To identify causative/contributing
factors:
• Assess knowledge of nutritional needs and amount of money
  spent/available for purchasing food.
• Ascertain how client perceives food and the act of eating.
• Review diary of foods/fluids ingested, times and patterns of
  eating, activities/place, whether alone or with other(s); and
  feelings before, during, and after eating.
• Calculate total calorie intake.
• Ascertain previous dieting history.
• Discuss client’s view of self, including what being fat does for
  the client. Active cultural practices may place high impor-
  tance on food and intake as well as large body size (e.g.,
  Samoan). Note negative/positive monologues (self-talk) of
  the individual.
• Obtain body drawing. (Client draws self on wall with
  chalk, then stands against it and actual body is drawn
  to determine difference between the two.) Determines
  whether client’s view of self-body image is congruent with
  reality.
• Ascertain occurrence of negative feedback from SO(s). May
  reveal control issues, impact motivation for change.
• Review daily activity and exercise program to identify areas
  for modification.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.         2. To establish weight reduction
program:
• Discuss client’s motivation for weight loss (e.g., for own satis-
  faction/self-esteem, or to gain approval from another person).
  Helps client determine realistic motivating factors for indi-
  vidual situation (e.g., acceptance of self “as is,” improvement
  of health status).
• Obtain commitment for weight loss if contracting is imple-
  mented.

     physician/dietitian guidelines.
   • Work with dietitian to assist in creating/evaluating nutri-
     tional program.
   • Set realistic goals for weekly weight loss.
   • Discuss eating behaviors (e.g., eating over sink, “nibbling,”
     kinds of activities associated with eating) and identify neces-
     sary modifications. Develop appetite-reeducation–plan to
     support continuation of behavioral changes.
   • Stress need for adequate fluid intake.
   • Encourage involvement in planned activity program of
     client’s choice and within physical abilities.
   • Monitor individual drug regimen (e.g., appetite suppressants,

     personal likes, meet individual needs, and are within financial
     budget.
   • Identify ways to manage stress/tension during meals.
     Promotes relaxation to permit focus on act of eating and
     awareness of satiety.
   • Review and discuss strategies to deal appropriately with feel-
     ings instead of overeating.
   • Encourage variety and moderation in dietary plan to decrease
     boredom.
   • Advise to plan for special occasions (birthday/holidays)
     by reducing intake before event and/or eating “smart”
     to redistribute/reduce calories and allow for partici-
     pation.
   • Discuss importance of an occasional treat by planning for
     inclusion in diet to avoid feelings of deprivation arising from
     self-denial.
   • Recommend client weigh only once per week, same
     time/clothes, and graph on chart. Measure/monitor body fat

NURSING PRIORITY NO.     1. To assess potential factors for unde-
sired weight gain:
• Note presence of factors as listed in Risk Factors. (A high
   correlation exists between obesity in parents and children.
   When one parent is obese, 40% of the children may be over-
   weight; when both are obese, the proportion may be as high
   as 80%.)
• Determine age and activity level/exercise patterns.
• Calculate growth percentiles in infants/children.
• Review laboratory data for indicators of endocrine/metabolic
   disorders.
• Determine weight change patterns, lifestyle, and cultural
   factors that may predispose to weight gain. Socio-economic
   group, amount of money available for purchasing food,
   proximity of grocery store, and available storage space
   for food are all factors that may impact food choices and
   intake.
• Assess eating patterns in relation to risk factors.
• Determine patterns of hunger and satiety. (Patterns differ in
   those who are predisposed to weight gain. Skipping meals
   decreases the metabolic rate.)
• Note history of dieting/kinds of diets used. Determine
   whether yo-yo dieting or bulimia is a factor.
• Identify personality characteristics that may indicate
   potential for obesity: for example, rigid thinking patterns,
   external locus of control, negative body image/self-
   concept, negative monologues (self-talk), dissatisfaction with
   life.
• Determine psychologic significance of food to the client.
• Listen to concerns and assess motivation to prevent weight
   gain.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.    2. To assist client to develop preventive
program to avoid weight gain:
• Provide information on balancing calorie intake and energy
  expenditure.
• Help client develop new eating patterns/habits (e.g.,
  eat slowly, eat when hungry, stop when full, do not skip
  meals).
• Discuss importance/help client develop a program of exercise
  and relaxation techniques. Encourages client to incorporate
  plan into lifestyle.
• Assist the client to develop strategies for reducing stressful
  thinking/actions. Promotes relaxation, reduces likelihood of
  stress/comfort eating.

     issues.
   • Provide information for new mothers about nutrition for
     developing babies.
   • Encourage the client to make a decision to lead an active life
     and control food habits.
   • Assist client in learning to be in touch with own body and to
     identify feelings that may provoke “comfort eating,” such as
     anger, anxiety, boredom, sadness.
   • Develop a system for self-monitoring to provide a sense of
     control and enable the client to follow own progress and

     Infants/children require small meals and constant atten-
     tion to needed nutrients for proper growth/develop-
     ment while dealing with child’s food preferences and eating
     habits.
   • Evaluate for influence of cultural factors to determine what
     client considers to be normal dietary practices, as well as to
     identify food preferences and eating patterns that can be
     strengthened and/or altered, if indicated.
   • Assess how client perceives food, food preparation, and the
     act of eating to determine client’s feeling and emotions
     regarding food and self-image.
   • Ascertain occurrence of/potential for negative feedback from
     SO(s). May reveal control issues that could impact client’s
     motivation for change.

     strengths and weaknesses in eating patterns and potential
     for change (e.g., person predisposed to weight gain may need
     a different time for a big meal than evening, or need to learn
     what foods reinforce feelings of satisfaction).
   • Assess client’s ability to safely store and prepare foods to
     determine if health information or resources might be
     needed.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.       2. To assist client/SO(s) to develop plan
   to meet individual needs:
   • Assist in obtaining/review results of individual testing (e.g.,
     weight/height, body fat percent, lipids, glucose, complete
     blood count, total protein, etc.) to determine that client is
     healthy and/or identify dietary changes that may be helpful
     in attaining health goals.
   • Encourage client’s beneficial eating patterns/habits (e.g.,
     controlling portion size, eating regular meals, reading product
     labels, reducing high-fat or fast-food intake, following specific
     dietary program, drinking water and healthy beverages).
     Positive feedback promotes continuation of healthy lifestyle
     habits and new behaviors.
   • Discuss use of rewards.
   • Provide instruction/reinforce information regarding special
     needs. Enhances decision-making process and promotes
     responsibility for meeting own needs.

  the amount of postoperative pain experienced; for exam-
  ple, vertical/diagonal incisions are more painful than
  transverse or S-shaped. Presence of known/unknown
  complication(s) may make the pain more severe than an-
  ticipated.
• Assess client’s perceptions, along with behavioral and physio-
  logic responses. Note client’s attitude toward pain and use of
  specific pain medications, including any history of substance
  abuse.
• Note client’s locus of control (internal/external). Individuals
  with external locus of control may take little or no responsi-
  bility for pain management.
• Assist in thorough diagnosis, including neurologic and
  psychologic factors (pain inventory, psychologic interview) as
  appropriate when pain persists.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.    2. To evaluate client’s response to pain:
• Perform pain assessment each time pain occurs. Note and
  investigate changes from previous reports to rule out
  worsening of underlying condition/development of compli-
  cations.
• Accept client’s description of pain. (Pain is a subjective
  experience and cannot be felt by others.) Acknowledge the
  pain experience and convey acceptance of client’s response to
  pain.
• Note cultural and developmental influences affecting pain
  response. (Verbal/behavioral cues may have no direct rela-
  tionship to the degree of pain perceived [e.g., stoic versus
  exaggerated].)
• Observe nonverbal cues (e.g., how client walks, holds
  body, sits; facial expression; cool fingertips/toes, which
  can mean constricted vessels) and other objective. Defining
  Characteristics as noted, especially in persons who cannot
  communicate verbally. Observations may/may not be
  congruent with verbal reports indicating need for further

• Assess for referred pain as appropriate to help determine
  possibility of underlying condition or organ dysfunction
  requiring treatment.
• Monitor vital signs—usually altered in acute pain.
• Ascertain client’s knowledge of and expectations about pain
  management.
• Review client’s previous experiences with pain and meth-

   • Provide quiet environment, calm activities.
   • Provide comfort measures (e.g., back rub, change of position,
      use of heat/cold) to provide nonpharmacologic pain manage-
      ment.
   • Instruct in/encourage use of relaxation exercises, such as
      focused breathing, commercial or individualized tapes (e.g.,
      “white” noise, music, instructional).
   • Encourage diversional activities (e.g., TV/radio, socialization
      with others).
   • Review procedures/expectations and tell client when treat-
      ment will hurt, use puppets to demonstrate procedure for
      child to reduce concern of the unknown and associated
      muscle tension.
   • Suggest parent be present during procedures to comfort
      child.
   • Identify ways of avoiding/minimizing pain (e.g., splinting
      incision during cough; firm mattress, and/or proper support-
      ing shoes for low back pain, good body mechanics).
   • Administer analgesics as indicated to maximal dosage as
      needed to maintain “acceptable” level of pain. Notify physi-
      cian if regimen is inadequate to meet pain control goal.
   • Demonstrate/monitor use of self-administration/client-
      controlled analgesia (PCA).
   • Assist client to alter drug regimen, based on individual needs.
      Increasing/decreasing dosage, stepped program (switching
      from injection to oral route, increased time span as pain
      lessens) helps in self-management of pain.
   • Note when pain occurs (e.g., only with ambulation, every
      evening) to medicate prophylactically as appropriate.
   • Instruct client in use of transcutaneous electrical stimulation
      (TENS) unit when ordered.
   • Assist in treatment of underlying disease processes causing

     [Diagnostic Division: Pain/Discomfort]
     Submitted 1986; Revised 1996
     Definition: Unpleasant sensory and emotional experi-
     ence arising from actual or potential tissue damage or
     described in terms of such damage (International
     Association for the Study of Pain); sudden or slow onset
     of any intensity from mild to severe, constant or recur-
     ring without an anticipated or predictable end and a
     duration of greater than 6 months
        [Pain is a signal that something is wrong. Chronic
     pain can be recurrent and periodically disabling (e.g.,
     migraine headaches) or may be unremitting. While
     chronic pain syndrome includes various learned behav-
     iors, psychological factors become the primary contribu-
     tion to impairment. It is a complex entity, combining
     elements from other NDs, such as Powerlessness;
     Diversional Activity, deficient; Family Processes, inter-

Family/SO(s) Will:
• Cooperate in pain management program. (Refer to ND
  Coping, family: readiness for enhanced.)
Actions/Interventions.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To assess etiology/precipitating
factors:
• Identify factors as outlined for ND Pain, acute.
• Assist in thorough diagnosis, including neurologic, psy-
  chologic evaluation (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
  Inventory—MMPI, pain inventory, psychologic interview).
• Assess for phantom limb pain when amputation has
  occurred.
• Evaluate emotional/physical components of individual situa-
  tion. Note codependent components, enabling behaviors of
  caregivers/family members that support continuation of the
  status quo.
• Determine cultural factors for the individual situation (e.g.,
  how expression of pain is accepted—moaning aloud or
  enduring in stoic silence; magnification of symptoms to
  convince others of reality of pain).
• Note sex and age of client. Current literature suggests there
  may be differences between women and men as to how they
  perceive and/or respond to pain. Sensitivity to pain is likely
  to decline as one gets older.
• Discuss use of nicotine, sugar, caffeine, white flour as appro-
  priate (some holistic practitioners believe these items need to
  be eliminated from the client’s diet).
• Evaluate current and past analgesic/narcotic drug use (includ-
  ing alcohol).
• Determine issues of secondary gain for the client/SO(s) (e.g.,
  financial/insurance, marital/family concern, work issues).
  May interfere with progress in pain management/resolution
  of situation.
• Make home visit when possible, observing such factors
  as safety equipment, adequate room, colors, plants, family
  interactions. Note impact of home environment on the
  client.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.     2. To determine client response to
chronic pain situation:
• Evaluate pain behavior. (May be exaggerated because client’s
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                      371


     perception of pain is not believed or because client believes
     caregivers are discounting reports of pain.)
   • Determine individual client threshold for pain (physical
     examination, pain profile, and the like).
   • Ascertain duration of pain problem, who has been consulted,
     and what drugs and therapies (including alternative/comple-
     mentary) have been used.
   • Note lifestyle effects of pain (e.g., decreased activity, weight
     loss or gain, sleep difficulties).
   • Assess degree of personal maladjustment of the client, such as
     isolationism, anger, irritability, loss of work time/job.
   • Note availability/use of personal and community resources.
   • Acknowledge and assess pain matter-of-factly, avoiding
     undue expressions of concern.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        3. To assist client to deal with pain:
   • Include client and SO(s) in establishing pattern of discussing
     pain for specified length of time to limit focusing on pain.
   • Use interventions from ND Pain, acute as appropriate (e.g.,
     heat/cold, splinting or exercises, hydrotherapy, electrical stim-
     ulation/TENS unit).
   • Review client expectations versus reality, because pain may
     not be resolved but can be significantly lessened or managed.
   • Discuss the physiologic dynamics of tension/anxiety and how
     this affects the pain.
   • Investigate and use nonpharmacologic methods of pain
     control (e.g., visualization, guided imagery, Therapeutic
     Touch [TT], progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback,
     massage).
   • Assist client to learn breathing techniques (e.g., diaphrag-
     matic breathing) to assist in muscle and generalized relax-
     ation.
   • Encourage client to use positive affirmations: “I am healing.”
     “I am relaxed.” “I love this life.” Have client be aware of
     internal-external dialogue. Say “cancel” when negative
     thoughts develop.
   • Use tranquilizers, narcotics, and analgesics sparingly. These
     changes are physically and psychologically addicting,
     promote sleep disturbances-especially interfering with deep
     REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, and client may need to
     be detoxified if many medications are currently used.
     Note: Antidepressants have an additional benefit of analgesic
     effects because perception of pain decreases as depression is
     lessened.
   • Encourage right-brain stimulation with activities such as love,
     laughter, and music to release endorphins, enhancing sense
     of well-being.
   • Encourage use of subliminal tapes to bypass logical part of
72 N U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E


  the brain by saying: “I am becoming a more relaxed person.”
                                                                    Pain, chronic
  “It is all right for me to relax.”
• Assist family in developing a program of positive reinforce-
  ment, encouraging client to use own control and diminishing
  attention given to pain behavior.
• Be alert to changes in pain. May indicate a new physical prob-
  lem.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
Discharge Considerations):
• Assist client and SO(s) to learn how to heal by developing
  sense of internal control, by being responsible for own treat-
  ment, and by obtaining the information and tools to accom-
  plish this.
• Discuss potential for developmental delays in child with
  chronic pain. Identify current level of function and review
  appropriate expectations for individual child.
• Review safe use of medications, side effects requiring medical
  evaluation.
• Assist client to learn to change pain behavior to wellness
  behavior. “Act as if you are well.”
• Encourage and assist family member/SO(s) to learn massage
  techniques.
• Recommend that client and SO(s) take time for themselves.
  Provides opportunity to re-energize and refocus on tasks at
  hand.
• Identify and discuss potential hazards of unproved and/or
  nonmedical therapies/remedies.
• Identify community support groups/resources to meet indi-
  vidual needs (e.g., yard care, home maintenance, alternative
  transportation). Proper use of resources may reduce negative
  pattern of “overdoing” heavy activities, then spending several
  days in bed recuperating.
• Refer for counseling and/or marital therapy, Parent
  Effectiveness classes, and so forth as needed. Presence of
  chronic pain affects all relationship/family dynamics.
• Refer to NDs Coping, ineffective; Coping, family: compro-
  mised.

Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.         1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Note family constellation; two-parent, single, extended
  family, or child living with other relative such as grandparent.
• Determine developmental stage of the family (e.g., new child,
  adolescent, child leaving/returning home).
• Assess family relationships and identify needs of individual
  members. Report and take necessary actions as legally/profes-
  sionally indicated if child’s safety is a concern.
• Assess parenting skill level, taking into account the individ-
  ual’s intellectual, emotional, and physical strengths and weak-
  nesses. (Parents with significant impairments may need more
  education/assistance.)
• Observe attachment behaviors between parental figure and
  child. (Refer to ND Attachment, risk for impaired parent/
  infant/child.)
• Note presence of factors in the child (e.g., birth defects,
  hyperactivity) that may affect attachment and caretaking
  needs.
• Evaluate physical challenges/limitations. Might affect the
  parent’s ability to care for a child (e.g., visual/hearing impair-
  ment, quadriplegia, severe depression).
• Determine presence/effectiveness of support systems, role
  models, extended family, and community resources available
  to the parent(s).

   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To foster development of parenting
   skills:
   • Create an environment in which relationships can be devel-
     oped and needs of each individual met. (Learning is more
     effective when individuals feel safe.)
   • Make time for listening to concerns of the parent(s).
   • Emphasize positive aspects of the situation, maintaining a
     hopeful attitude toward the parent’s capabilities and potential
     for improving the situation.
   • Note staff attitudes toward parent/child and specific prob-
     lem/disability; for example, needs of disabled parent(s) to be
     seen as an individual and evaluated apart from a stereotype.
     Negative attitudes are detrimental to promoting positive
     outcomes.
   • Encourage expression of feelings, such as helplessness, anger,
     frustration. Set limits on unacceptable behaviors.
   • Acknowledge difficulty of situation and normalcy of feelings.
     Enhances feelings of acceptance.
   • Recognize stages of grieving process when the child is
     disabled or other than anticipated (e.g., girl instead of boy,
     misshapen head/prominent birthmark). Allow time for
     parents to express feelings and deal with the “loss.”
   • Encourage attendance at skill classes (e.g., Parent
     Effectiveness) to assist in developing communication and
     problem-solving techniques.
   • Emphasize parenting functions rather than mothering/father-
     ing skills. By virtue of gender, each person brings something
     to the parenting role; however, nurturing tasks can be done
     by both parents.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote wellness (Teaching/

     (e.g., extended family, friends, social worker, home care serv-
     ices).
   • Assist parent to plan time and conserve energy in positive
     ways. Enables individual to cope effectively with difficulties
     as they arise.
   • Encourage parents to identify positive outlets for meeting
     their own needs (e.g., going out for dinner, making time for
     their own interests and each other/dating). Promotes general
     well-being, helps reduce burnout.

   Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
   Criteria—Client Will:
   • Verbalize realistic information and expectations of parenting
     role.
   • Identify own strengths, individual needs, and methods/
     resources to meet them.
   • Demonstrate appropriate attachment/parenting behaviors.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.         1. To determine need/motivation for
   improvement:
   • Note family constellation: two-parent, single, extended family,
     or child living with other relative, such as grandparent.
     Understanding makeup of the family provides information
     about needs to assist them in improving their family connec-
     tions.
   • Determine developmental stage of the family (e.g., new child,
     adolescent, child leaving/returning home, retirement). These
     maturational crises bring changes in the family, which can
     provide opportunity for enhancing parenting skills and
     improving family interactions.
   • Assess family relationships and identify needs of individual
     members, noting any special concerns that exist, such as, birth
     defects, illness, hyperactivity. The family is a system and when
     members make decision to improve parenting skills, the
     changes affect all parts of the system. Identifying needs,
     special situations, and relationships can help to develop plan
     to bring about effective change.
   • Assess parenting skill level, taking into account the individ-
     ual’s intellectual, emotional, and physical strengths and weak-
     nesses. Identifies areas of need for education, skill training,
82 N U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E


  and information on which to base plan for enhancing parent-
                                                                    Parenting, readiness for enhanced
  ing skills.
• Observe attachment behaviors between parent(s) and
  child(ren), recognizing cultural background which may influ-
  ence expected behaviors. Behaviors such as eye-to-eye
  contact, use of en-face position, talking to infant in high-
  pitched voice are indicative of attachment behaviors in
  American culture but may not be appropriate in another
  culture. Failure to bond is thought to affect subsequent
  parent-child interactions.
• Determine presence/effectiveness of support systems, role
  models, extended family, and community resources available
  to the parent(s). Parents desiring to enhance abilities and
  improve family life can benefit by role models that help them
  develop own style of parenting.
• Note cultural/religious influences on parenting, expectations
  of self/child, sense of success or failure. Expectations may
  vary with different cultures (e.g., Arab-Americans hold chil-
  dren to be sacred but child-rearing is based on negative
  rather than positive reinforcements and parents are more
  strict with girls than boys). These beliefs may interfere with
  desire to improve parenting skills when there is conflict
  between the two.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.    2. To foster improvement of parenting
skills:
• Create an environment in which relationships can be devel-
  oped and needs of each individual family member can be met.
  A safe environment in which individuals can freely express
  their thoughts and feelings optimizes learning and positive
  interactions among family members enhancing relation-
  ships.
• Make time for listening to concerns of the parent(s).
  Promotes sense of importance and of being heard and iden-
  tifies accurate information regarding needs of the family for
  enhancing relationships.
• Encourage expression of feelings, such as helplessness,
  anger while setting limits on unacceptable behaviors. Identi-
  fication of feelings promotes understanding of self and
  enhances connections with others in the family. Unac-
  ceptable behaviors result in feelings of anger and diminished
  self-esteem and can lead to problems in the family relation-
  ships.
• Emphasize parenting functions rather than mothering/
  fathering skills. By virtue of gender, each person brings
  something to the parenting role; however, nurturing tasks
  can be done by both parents, enhancing family relation-
  ships.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                     383


   • Encourage attendance at skill classes, such as Parent
     Effectiveness Training. Assists in developing communication
     skills of Active-listening, I-messages, and problem-solving
     techniques to improve family relationships and promote a
     win-win environment.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        3. To promote optimal wellness:
   • Involve all members of the family in learning. The family
     system benefits from all members participating in learning
     new skills to enhance family relationships.
   • Encourage parents to identify positive outlets for meeting
     their own needs. Activities, such as going out for dinner,
     making time for their own interests and each other/dating
     promotes general well-being, enhance family relationships
     and improve family functioning.
   • Provide information as indicated, including time manage-
     ment, stress-reduction techniques. Learning about positive
     parenting skills, understanding growth and developmental
     expectations, and ways to reduce stress and anxiety promotes
     individual’s ability to deal with problems that may arise in
     the course of family relationships.
   • Discuss current ‘family rules,’ identifying areas of needed
     change. Rules may be imposed by adults, rather than through
     a democratic process involving all family members, leading
     to conflict and angry confrontations. Setting positive family
     rules with all family members participating can promote an
     effective, functional family.
   • Discuss need for long-term planning and ways in which
     family can maintain desired positive relationships. Each
     stage of life brings its own challenges and understanding
     and preparing for each one enables family members to
     move through them in positive ways, promoting family
     unity and resolving inevitable conflicts with win-win solu-
     tions.

     formation. Measure affected extremity and compare with
     unaffected extremity.
   • Note position/location of casts, braces, traction apparatus.
   • Review recent/current drug regimen, noting use of anticoag-
     ulants and vasoactive agents.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.         2. To prevent deterioration/maximize
   circulation of affected limb(s):
   • Remove jewelry from affected limb.
   • Limit/avoid use of restraints. Pad limb and evaluate status
     frequently, if restraints are required.
   • Monitor entire length of injured extremity for swelling/edema
     formation. Note appearance, spread of hematoma.
   • Monitor presence/quality of peripheral pulse distal to injury
     or impairment via palpation/Doppler. Occasionally a pulse
     may be palpated even though circulation is blocked by a soft
     clot through which pulsations may be felt; or perfusion
     through larger arteries may continue after increased
     compartment pressure has collapsed the arteriole/venule
     circulation in the muscle.
   • Assess capillary return, skin color, and warmth in the limb(s)
     at risk and compare with unaffected extremities. Peripheral
     pulses, capillary refill, skin color, and sensation may be
     normal even in the presence of compartmental syndrome,
     because superficial circulation is usually not compromised.
   • Perform neurovascular assessments, noting changes in
     motor/sensory function. Ask client to localize pain/discom-
     fort, and to report numbness and tingling; presence of
     pain with exercise or rest (atherosclerotic changes). Refer
     to ND Tissue Perfusion, ineffective (specify type: renal,
     cerebral, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, peripheral), as
     appropriate.
   • Test sensation of peroneal nerve by pinch/pinprick in the
     dorsal web between first and second toe, and assess ability to
     dorsiflex toes if indicated (e.g., presence of leg fracture).
   • Inspect tissues around cast edges for rough places, pressure
     points. Investigate reports of “burning sensation” under cast.
   • Observe position/location of supporting ring of splints/sling.
     Readjust as indicated.
   • Maintain elevation of injured extremity(ies) unless con-
     traindicated by confirmed presence of compartment syn-
     drome. In presence of increased compartment pressure,
     elevation of extremity actually impedes arterial flow,
     decreasing perfusion.
   • Apply ice bags around injury/fracture site as indicated.
   • Investigate sudden signs of limb ischemia (e.g., decreased skin
     temperature, pallor, increased pain), reports of pain that is

•   Prepare for surgical intervention (e.g., fibulectomy/
    fasciotomy) as indicated to relieve pressure/restore circula-
    tion.
•   Use techniques, such as repositioning/padding, to relieve
    pressure.
•   Encourage client to routinely exercise digits/joints distal to
    injury. Encourage ambulation as soon as possible.
•   Evaluate for tenderness, swelling, pain on dorsiflexion of foot
    (positive Homans’ sign).
•   Keep linens off affected extremity with bed cradle.
•   Apply antiembolic hose/sequential pressure device as indi-
    cated.
•   Monitor Hb/Hct, coagulation studies (e.g., prothrombin
    time).
•   Administer IV fluids, blood products as needed to maintain
    circulating volume/tissue perfusion.
•   Administer anticoagulants as indicated for thrombotic vascu-
    lar obstructions.

• Verbalize acceptance of changes that have occurred.
• State ability to identify and accept self (long-term outcome).
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.       1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Ascertain client’s perception of the extent of the threat to self
  and how client is handling the situation.
• Determine speed of occurrence of threat. An event that has
  happened quickly may be more threatening.
• Define disturbed body image. (Body image is the basis of
  personal identity.)
• Be aware of physical signs of panic state. (Refer to ND
  Anxiety.)
• Note age of client. An adolescent may struggle with the
  developmental task of personal/sexual identity, whereas an
  older person may have more difficulty accepting/deal-
  ing with a threat to identity, such as progressive loss of
  memory.
• Assess availability and use of support systems. Note response
  of family/SO(s).
• Note withdrawn/automatic behavior, regression to earlier
  developmental stage, general behavioral disorganization, or
  display of self-mutilation behaviors in adolescent or adult;
  delayed development, preference for solitary play, display of
  self-stimulation in child.
• Determine presence of hallucinations/delusions, distortions
  of reality.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.     2. To assist client to manage/deal with
threat:
• Make time to listen to client, encouraging appropriate expres-
  sion of feelings, including anger and hostility.
• Provide calm environment.
• Use crisis-intervention principles to restore equilibrium
  when possible.

   • Assist client to develop strategies to cope with threat to iden-
     tity. Helps reduce anxiety and promotes self-awareness and
     self-esteem.
   • Engage client in activities to help in identifying self as an indi-
     vidual (e.g., use of mirror for visual feedback, tactile stimula-
     tion).
   • Provide for simple decisions, concrete tasks, calming activi-
     ties.
   • Allow client to deal with situation in small steps because
     may be unable to cope with larger picture when in stress
     overload.
   • Assist client in developing/participating in an individu-
     alized exercise program (walking is an excellent beginning
     program).
   • Provide concrete assistance as needed (e.g., help with ADLs,
     providing food).
   • Take advantage of opportunities to promote growth. Realize
     that client will have difficulty learning while in a dissociative
     state.
   • Maintain reality orientation without confronting client’s irra-
     tional beliefs. Client may become defensive, blocking oppor-
     tunity to look at other possibilities.
   • Use humor judiciously when appropriate.
   • Discuss options for dealing with issues of sexual gender (e.g.,
     therapy/gender-change surgery when client is a transsexual).
   • Refer to NDs Body Image, disturbed; Self-Esteem [specify];
     Spiritual Distress.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Provide accurate information about threat to and potential
     consequences for individual.
   • Assist client and SO(s) to acknowledge and integrate threat
     into future planning (e.g., wearing ID bracelet when prone to
     mental confusion; change of lifestyle to accommodate change
     of gender for transsexual client).

   • Report absence of physical manifestations (such as pain,
     chronic fatigue).
   • Refer to ND Rape-Trauma Syndrome for additional outcomes
     when trauma is the result of rape.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.       1. To assess causative factor(s) and indi-
   vidual reaction:
   ACUTE
   • Observe for and elicit information about physical or psycho-
     logical injury and note associated stress-related symptoms
     such as “numbness,” headache, tightness in chest, nausea,
     pounding heart, and so forth.
   • Identify psychologic responses: anger, shock, acute anxiety,
     confusion, denial. Note laughter, crying; calm or agitated,
     excited (hysterical) behavior; expressions of disbelief and/or
     self-blame, lability of emotional changes.
   • Assess client’s knowledge of and anxiety related to the situa-
     tion. Note ongoing threat to self (e.g., contact with perpetra-
     tor and/or associates).
   • Identify social aspects of trauma/incident (e.g., disfigurement,
     chronic conditions/permanent disabilities).
   • Ascertain ethnic, background/cultural and religious percep-
     tions and beliefs about the occurrence (e.g., retribution from
     God).
   • Determine degree of disorganization.
   • Identify whether incident has reactivated preexisting or coex-
     isting situations (physical/psychological). Affects how the
     client views the trauma.
   • Determine disruptions in relationships (e.g., family, friends,
     coworkers, SOs). Support persons may not know how to
     deal with client/situation (e.g., be oversolicitous or with-
     draw).
   • Note withdrawn behavior, use of denial, and use of chemical
     substances or impulsive behaviors (e.g., chain-smoking,
     overeating).
   • Be aware of signs of increasing anxiety (e.g., silence, stutter-
     ing, inability to sit still). Increasing anxiety may indicate risk
     for violence.
   • Note verbal/nonverbal expressions of guilt or self-blame
     when client has survived trauma in which others died.
   • Assess signs/stage of grieving for self and others.
   • Identify development of phobic reactions to ordinary articles
     (e.g., knives); situations (e.g., walking in groups of people,
     strangers ringing doorbell).

CHRONIC (IN ADDITION TO PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT)
                                                                       Post-Trauma Syndrome [specify stage]
• Evaluate continued somatic complaints (e.g., gastric irrita-
  tion, anorexia, insomnia, muscle tension, headache). Investi-
  gate reports of new/changes in symptoms.
• Note manifestations of chronic pain or pain symptoms in
  excess of degree of physical injury.
• Be aware of signs of severe/prolonged depression; note pres-
  ence of flashbacks, intrusive memories, and/or nightmares.
• Assess degree of dysfunctional coping (e.g., use of chemical
  substances/substance abuse) and consequences.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.     2. To assist client to deal with situation
that exists:
ACUTE
• Provide a calm, safe environment. Promotes sense of trust
  and safety.
• Assist with documentation for police report, as indicated, and
  stay with the client.
• Listen to/investigate physical complaints. Emotional reac-
  tions may limit client’s ability to recognize physical injury.
• Identify supportive persons for this individual.
• Remain with client, listen as client recounts incident/
  concerns—possibly repeatedly. (If client does not want to
  talk, accept silence.) Provides psychologic support.
• Provide environment in which client can talk freely about
  feelings, fear (including concerns about relationship with/
  response of SO), and experiences/sensations (e.g., loss of con-
  trol, “near-death experience”).
• Help child to express feelings about event using techniques
  appropriate to developmental level (e.g., play for young child,
  stories/puppets for preschooler, peer group for adolescent).
  Children are more likely to express in play what they may not
  be able to verbalize directly.
• Assist with practical realities (e.g., temporary housing,
  money, notifications of family members, or other needs).
• Be aware of and assist client to use ego strengths in a positive
  way by acknowledging ability to handle what is happening.
  Enhances self-concept, reduces sense of helplessness.
• Allow the client to work through own kind of adjustment. If
  the client is withdrawn or unwilling to talk, do not force the
  issue.
• Listen for expressions of fear of crowds and/or people.
CHRONIC
• Continue listening to expressions of concern. May need to
  continue to talk about the incident.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                        399


   • Permit free expression of feelings (may continue from the
     crisis phase). Do not rush client through expressions of feel-
     ings too quickly and do not reassure inappropriately. Client
     may believe pain and/or anguish is misunderstood and may
     be depressed. Statements such as “You don’t understand” or
     “You weren’t there” are a defense, a way of pushing others
     away.
   • Encourage client to talk out experience, expressing feelings
     of fear, anger, loss/grief. (Refer to ND Grieving, dysfunc-
     tional).
   • Ascertain/monitor sleep pattern of children as well as adults.
     Sleep disturbances/nightmares may develop delaying resolu-
     tion, impairing coping abilities.
   • Encourage client to become aware of and accepting of own
     feelings and reactions when identified.
   • Acknowledge reality of loss of self, which existed before the
     incident. Assist client to move toward an acceptance of the
     potential for growth that exists within client.
   • Continue to allow client to progress at own pace.
   • Give “permission” to express/deal with anger at the assailant/
     situation in acceptable ways.
   • Keep discussion on practical and emotional level rather than
     intellectualizing the experience, which allows client to avoid
     dealing with feelings.
   • Assist in dealing with practical concerns and effects of the
     incident, such as court appearances, altered relationships with
     SO(s), employment problems.
   • Provide for sensitive, trained counselors/therapists and
     engage in therapies, such as psychotherapy in conjunction
     with medications, Implosive Therapy (flooding), hypnosis,
     relaxation, Rolfing, memory work, cognitive restructuring,
     Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR),
     physical and occupational therapies.
   • Discuss use of medication (e.g., antidepressants). Lithium
     may be used to reduce explosiveness; low-dose psychotropics
     may be used when loss of contact with reality is a problem.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Assist client to identify and monitor feelings while therapy is
     occurring.
   • Provide information about what reactions client may expect
     during each phase. Let client know these are common reac-
     tions. Be sure to phrase in neutral terms of “You may or you
     may not….” Helps reduce fear of the unknown.
   • Assist client to identify factors that may have created a vulner-
     able situation and that he or she may have power to change to
     protect self in the future.

• Discuss lifestyle changes client is contemplating and how they
  may contribute to recovery. Helps client evaluate appropri-
  ateness of plans.
• Assist with learning stress-management techniques.
• Discuss recognition of and ways to manage “anniversary reac-
  tions,” letting client know normalcy of recurrence of thoughts
  and feelings at this time.
• Suggest support group for SO(s) to assist with understanding
  of and ways to deal with client.
• Encourage psychiatric consultation, especially if client is
  unable to maintain control, is violent, is inconsolable, or does
  not seem to be making an adjustment. Participation in a
  group may be helpful.
• Refer to family/marital counseling if indicated.
• Refer to NDs Powerlessness; Coping, ineffective; Grieving,
  anticipatory/dysfunctional.

NURSING PRIORITY NO.     2. To assist client to deal with situation
that exists:
• Educate high-risk persons/families about signs/symptoms of
  post-trauma response, especially if it is likely to occur in their
  occupation/life.
• Identify and discuss client’s strengths (e.g., very supportive
  family, usually copes well with stress, etc.) as well as vulnera-
  bilities (e.g., client tends toward alcohol/other drugs for
  coping, client has witnessed a murder, etc.)
• Discuss how individual coping mechanisms have worked in
  past traumatic events.
• Evaluate client’s perceptions of events and personal signifi-
  cance (e.g., policeman/parent investigating death of a child).
• Provide emotional and physical presence to strengthen
  client’s coping abilities.
• Encourage expression of feelings. Note whether feelings
  expressed appear congruent with events the client experi-
  enced. Incongruency may indicate deeper conflict and can
  impede resolution.
• Observe for signs and symptoms of stress responses, such as
  nightmares, reliving an incident, poor appetite, irritability,
  numbness and crying, family/relationship disruption. These
  responses are normal in the early postincident time frame. If
  prolonged and persistent, the client may be experiencing
  post-traumatic stress disorder.

Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Identify situational circumstances (e.g., strange environment,
  immobility, diagnosis of terminal/chronic illness, lack of
  support system(s), lack of knowledge about situation).
• Determine client’s perception/knowledge of condition and
  treatment plan.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                             405


   • Ascertain client response to treatment regimen. Does client
      see reason(s) and understand it is in the client’s interest or is
      client compliant and helpless?
   • Identify client locus of control: internal (expressions of
      responsibility for self and ability to control outcomes “I didn’t
      quit smoking”) or external (expressions of lack of control
      over self and environment—“Nothing ever works out”;
      “What bad luck to get lung cancer”).
   • Assess degree of mastery client has exhibited in life.
   • Determine if there has been a change in relationships with
      SO(s).
   • Note availability/use of resources.
   • Investigate caregiver practices. Do they support client
      control/responsibility?
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.         2. To assess degree of powerlessness
   experienced by the client/SO(s):
   • Listen to statements client makes: “They don’t care”; “It won’t
      make any difference”; “Are you kidding?”
   • Note expressions that indicate “giving up,” such as “It won’t do
      any good.”
   • Note behavioral responses (verbal and nonverbal) includ-
      ing expressions of fear, interest or apathy, agitation, with-
      drawal.
   • Note lack of communication, flat affect, and lack of eye
      contact.
   • Identify the use of manipulative behavior and reactions of
      client and caregivers. (Manipulation is used for management
      of powerlessness because of distrust of others, fear of inti-
      macy, search for approval, and validation of sexuality.)
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To assist client to clarify needs rela-
   tive to ability to meet them:
   • Show concern for client as a person.
   • Make time to listen to client’s perceptions and concerns and
      encourage questions.
   • Accept expressions of feelings, including anger and hopeless-
      ness.
   • Avoid arguing or using logic with hopeless client. Client will
      not believe it can make a difference.
   • Express hope for the client. (There is always hope of some-
      thing.)
   • Identify strengths/assets and past coping strategies that were
      successful. Helps client to recognize own ability to deal with
      difficult situation.
   • Assist client to identify what he or she can do for self. Identify
      things the client can/cannot control.

  situation.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.      4. To promote independence:
• Use client’s locus of control to develop individual plan of care
  (e.g., for client with internal control, encourage client to take
  control of own care and for those with external control, begin
  with small tasks and add as tolerated).
• Develop contract with client specifying goals agreed on.
  Enhances commitment to plan, optimizing outcomes.
• Treat expressed decisions and desires with respect. (Avoid
  critical parenting behaviors.)
• Provide client opportunities to control as many events as
  energy and restrictions of care permit.
• Discuss needs openly with client and set up agreed-on
  routines for meeting identified needs. Minimizes use of
  manipulation.
• Minimize rules and limit continuous observation to the
  degree that safety permits to provide sense of control for the
  client.
• Support client efforts to develop realistic steps to put plan
  into action, reach goals, and maintain expectations.
• Provide positive reinforcement for desired behaviors.
• Direct client’s thoughts beyond present state to future when
  appropriate.
• Schedule frequent brief visits to check on client, deal with
  client needs, and let client know someone is available.
• Involve SO(s) in client care as appropriate.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 5. To promote wellness (Teaching/
Discharge Considerations):
• Instruct in/encourage use of anxiety and stress-reduction
  techniques.
• Provide accurate verbal and written information about what
  is happening and discuss with client/SO(s). Repeat as often as
  necessary.
• Assist client to set realistic goals for the future.
• Assist client to learn/use assertive communication skills.
• Facilitate return to a productive role in whatever capacity

   Decreased self-esteem; low or unstable body image
  NOTE: A risk diagnosis is not evidenced by signs and symptoms, as
  the problem has not occurred and nursing interventions are
  directed at prevention.
Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
Criteria—Client Will:
• Express sense of control over the present situation and hope-
  fulness about future outcomes.
• Make choices related to and be involved in care.
• Identify areas over which individual has control.
• Acknowledge reality that some areas are beyond individual’s
  control.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Identify situational circumstances (e.g., acute illness, sudden
  hospitalization, diagnosis of terminal or debilitating/chronic
  illness, very young or aging with decreased physical strength
  and mobility, lack of knowledge about illness, healthcare
  system).
• Determine client’s perception/knowledge of condition and
  proposed treatment plan.
• Identify client’s locus of control: Internal (expressions of
  responsibility for self and environment) or external (expres-
  sions of lack of control over self and environment).
• Assess client’s self-esteem and degree of mastery client has
  exhibited in life situations.
• Note availability and use of resources.
• Listen to statements client makes which might indicate feel-
  ings of powerlessness (e.g., “They don’t care”; “It won’t make
  a difference”; “It won’t do any good”).
• Observe behavioral responses (verbal and nonverbal) for
  expressions of fear, disinterest or apathy, or withdrawal.
• Be alert for signs of manipulative behavior and note reac-
  tions of client and caregivers. (Manipulation may be used for
  management of powerlessness because of fear and distrust.)
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assist client to clarify needs and
ability to meet them:
• Show concern for client as a person. Encourage questions.
• Make time to listen to client’s perceptions of the situation as
  well as concerns.

   Authors’ note: The purpose of this diagnosis seems to
combine multiple NDs under a single heading for ease of plan-
ning care when a number of variables may be present.
Outcomes/evaluation criteria and interventions are specifically
tied to individual related factors that are present, such as:
   Extremes of age: Concerns may include body temperature/
      thermoregulation or thought process/sensory-perceptual
      alterations, as well as risk for trauma, suffocation, or
      poisoning; and fluid volume imbalances.
   Inadequate nutrition: Brings up issues of nutrition, less than
      body requirements; infection, altered thought processes,
      trauma, ineffective coping, and altered family processes.
    Information that appears in brackets has been added by the authors
 to clarify and enhance the use of nursing diagnoses.                     411


      Alcohol abuse: May be situational or chronic with problems
         ranging from ineffective breathing patterns, decreased
         cardiac output, and fluid volume deficit to nutritional
         problems, infection, trauma, altered thought processes,
         and coping/family process difficulties.
      Abnormal blood profile: Suggests possibility of fluid volume
         deficit, decreased tissue perfusion, impaired gas exchange,
         activity intolerance, or risk for infection.
      Drug therapies, treatments, and disease concerns: Would
         include risk for infection, fluid volume imbalances, altered
         skin/tissue integrity, pain, nutritional problems, fatigue,
         and emotional responses.
      It is suggested that the user refer to specific NDs based on
   identified related factors and individual concerns for this client
   to find appropriate outcomes and interventions.

   • Report absence of physical complications, pain, and discom-
     fort.
   • Verbalize a positive self-image.
   • Verbalize recognition that incident was not of own doing.
   • Identify behaviors/situations within own control that may
     reduce risk of recurrence.

     job/residence) as necessary and seek/obtain support from
     SO(s) as needed.
   • Interact with individuals/groups in desired and acceptable
     manner.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.       1. To assess trauma and individual reac-
   tion, noting length of time since occurrence of event:
   • Observe for and elicit information about physical injury
     and assess stress-related symptoms, such as numbness,
     headache, tightness in chest, nausea, pounding heart, and so
     forth.
   • Identify psychologic responses: anger, shock, acute anxiety,
     confusion, denial. Note laughter, crying, calm or agitated,
     excited (hysterical) behavior, expressions of disbelief, and/or
     self-blame.
   • Note signs of increasing anxiety (e.g., silence, stuttering,
     inability to sit still).
   • Determine degree of disorganization.
   • Identify whether incident has reactivated preexisting or coex-
     isting situations (physical/psychological). Can affect how the
     client views the trauma.
   • Determine disruptions in relationships with men and with
     others (e.g., family, friends, coworkers, SO[s]).
   • Identify development of phobic reactions to ordinary articles
     (e.g., knives) and situations (e.g., walking in groups of people,
     strangers ringing doorbell).
   • Note degree of intrusive repetitive thoughts, sleep distur-
     bances.
   • Assess degree of dysfunctional coping (e.g., use of alcohol,
     other drugs, suicidal/homicidal ideation, marked change in
     sexual behavior).
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        2. To assist client to deal with situation
   that exists:
   • Explore own feelings (nurse/caregiver) regarding rape/
     incest issue prior to interacting with the client. Need to
     recognize own biases to prevent imposing them on the
     client.

ACUTE PHASE
• Stay with the client/do not leave child unattended. Provides
  reassurance/sense of safety.
• Involve rape response team when available. Provide same-sex
  examiner when appropriate.
• Evaluate infant/child/adolescent as dictated by age, sex, and
  developmental level.
• Assist with documentation of incident for police/child-
  protective services reports, maintain sequencing and collec-
  tion of evidence (chain of evidence), label each specimen, and
  store/package properly.
• Provide environment in which client can talk freely about
  feelings and fears, including concerns about relationship
  with/response of SO(s), pregnancy, sexually transmitted
  diseases.
• Provide psychologic support by listening and remaining with
  client. If client does not want to talk, accept silence. May indi-
  cate Silent Reaction.
• Listen to/investigate physical complaints. Assist with medical
  treatments as indicated. Emotional reactions may limit
  client’s ability to recognize physical injury.
• Assist with practical realities (e.g., safe temporary housing,
  money, or other needs).
• Be aware of client’s ego strengths and assist client to use them
  in a positive way by acknowledging client’s ability to handle
  what is happening.
• Identify supportive persons for this individual.
POSTACUTE PHASE
• Allow the client to work through own kind of adjust-
  ment. May be withdrawn or unwilling to talk; do not force
  the issue.
• Listen for expressions of fear of crowds, men, and so forth.
  May reveal developing phobias.
• Discuss specific concerns/fears. Identify appropriate actions
  (e.g., diagnostic testing for pregnancy, sexually transmitted
  diseases) and provide information as indicated.
• Include written instructions that are concise and clear regard-
  ing medical treatments, crisis support services, and so on.
  Reinforces teaching, provides opportunity to deal with infor-
  mation at own pace.
LONG-TERM PHASE
• Continue listening to expressions of concern. May need to
  continue to talk about the assault. Note persistence of
  somatic complaints (e.g., nausea, anorexia, insomnia, muscle
  tension, headache).
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                         415


   • Permit free expression of feelings (may continue from the
     crisis phase). Do not rush client through expressions of feel-
     ings too quickly and do not reassure inappropriately. Client
     may believe pain and/or anguish is misunderstood and
     depression may limit responses.
   • Acknowledge reality of loss of self that existed before the inci-
     dent. Assist client to move toward an acceptance of the poten-
     tial for growth that exists within individual.
   • Continue to allow client to progress at own pace.
   • Give “permission” to express/deal with anger at the perpetra-
     tor/situation in acceptable ways. Set limits on destructive
     behaviors. Facilitates resolution of feelings without dimin-
     ishing self-concept.
   • Keep discussion on practical and emotional level rather than
     intellectualizing the experience, which allows client to avoid
     dealing with feelings.
   • Assist in dealing with ongoing concerns about and effects
     of the incident, such as court appearance, pregnancy, sexu-
     ally transmitted disease, relationship with SO(s), and so
     forth.
   • Provide for sensitive, trained counselors, considering individ-
     ual needs. (Male/female counselors may be best de-
     termined on an individual basis as counselor’s gender
     may be an issue for some clients, affecting ability to
     disclose.)
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Provide information about what reactions client may expect
     during each phase. Let client know these are common reac-
     tions. Be sure to phrase in neutral terms of “You may or
     may not…” (Be aware that, although male rape perpetrators
     are usually heterosexual, the male victim may be concerned
     about his own sexuality and may exhibit a homophobic
     response.)
   • Assist client to identify factors that may have created a vulner-
     able situation and that she or he may have power to change to
     protect self in the future.
   • Avoid making value judgments.
   • Discuss lifestyle changes client is contemplating and how they
     will contribute to recovery. Helps client evaluate appropriate-
     ness of plans.
   • Encourage psychiatric consultation if client is violent, incon-
     solable, or does not seem to be making an adjustment.
     Participation in a group may be helpful.
   • Refer to family/marital counseling as indicated.
   • Refer to NDs Powerlessness; Coping, ineffective; Grieving,
     anticipatory/dysfunctional; Anxiety; Fear.

   • Participate in family/group/community activities to enhance
      self-concept.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 1. To assess current situation and desire
   for improvement:
   • Determine current status of individual’s belief about self. Self-
      concept consists of the physical self (body image), personal
      self (identity) and self-esteem, and information about client’s
       Information that appears in brackets has been added by the authors
30 to clarify and enhance the use of nursing diagnoses.

                                                                        Self-Concept, readiness for enhanced
    changes to improve self.
•   Determine availability/quality of family/SO(s) support.
    Presence of supportive people who reflect positive attitudes
    regarding the individual promotes a positive sense of self.
•   Identify family dynamics, present and past. Self-esteem
    begins in early childhood and is influenced by the percep-
    tions of how the individual is viewed by significant others.
    Provides information about family functioning that will help
    to develop plan of care for enhancing client’s self-concept.
•   Note willingness to seek assistance, motivation for change.
    Individuals who have a sense of their own self-image and are
    willing to look at themselves realistically will be able to
    progress in the desire to improve.
•   Determine client’s concept of self in relation to cultural/reli-
    gious ideals/beliefs.
•   Observe nonverbal behaviors and note congruence with
    verbal expressions. Discuss cultural meanings of nonverbal
    communication. Incongruencies between verbal and nonver-
    bal communication require clarification. Interpretation of
    nonverbal expressions is culturally determined and needs to
    be identified to avoid misinterpretation.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.      2. To facilitate personal growth:
• Develop therapeutic relationship. Be attentive, validate client’s
  communication, provide encouragement for efforts, maintain
  open communication, use skills of Active-listening and I-
  messages. Promotes trusting situation in which client is free
  to be open and honest with self and others.
• Accept client’s perceptions/view of current status. Avoids
  threatening existing self-esteem and provides opportunity
  for client to develop realistic plan for improving self-concept.
• Be aware that people are not programmed to be rational.
  They must seek information, choosing to learn, to think ra-
  ther than merely accepting/reacting in order to have respect
  for self, facts, honesty, and to develop positive self-esteem.
• Discuss client perception of self, confronting misconceptions
  and identifying negative self-talk. Address distortions in
  thinking, such as self-referencing (beliefs that others are
  focusing on individual’s weaknesses/limitations); filtering
  (focusing on negative and ignoring positive); catastrophizing
  (expecting the worst outcomes). Addressing these issues
  openly allows client to identify things that may negatively
  affect self-esteem and provides opportunity for change.
• Have client list current/past successes and strengths.
  Emphasizes fact that client is and has been successful in
  many actions taken.
• Use positive I-messages rather than praise. Praise is a form of
        NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                        431


     external control, coming from outside sources, whereas I-
     messages allow the client to develop internal sense of self-
     esteem.
   • Discuss what behavior does for client (positive intention). Ask
     what options are available to the client/SO(s)? Encourages
     thinking about what inner motivations are and what actions
     can be taken to enhance self-esteem.
   • Give reinforcement for progress noted. Positive words of
     encouragement support development of effective coping
     behaviors.
   • Allow client to progress at own rate. Adaptation to a change
     in self-concept depends on its significance to the individual
     and disruption to lifestyle.
   • Involve in activities/exercise program of choice, promote
     socialization. Enhances sense of well-being/can help to ener-
     gize client.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote optimum sense of self-
   worth and happiness:
   • Assist client to identify goals that are personally achievable.
     Provide positive feedback for verbal and behavioral indica-
     tions of improved self-view. Increases likelihood of success
     and commitment to change.
   • Refer to vocational/employment counselor, educational
     resources as appropriate. Assists with improving develop-
     ment of social/vocational skills.
   • Encourage participation in classes/activities/hobbies that
     client enjoys or would like to experience. Provides opportu-
     nity for learning new information/skills that can enhance
     feelings of success, improving self-esteem.
   • Reinforce that current decision to improve self-concept is
     ongoing. Continued work and support are necessary to
     sustain behavior changes/personal growth.
   • Suggest assertiveness training classes. Promotes learning to
     assist with developing new skills to promote self-esteem.
   • Emphasize importance of grooming and personal hygiene
     and assist in developing skills to improve appearance and
     dress for success. Looking your best improves sense of self-
     esteem and presenting a positive appearance enhances how
     others see you.

    to be open and honest with self and therapist.
•   Address presenting medical/safety issues.
•   Accept client’s perceptions/view of situation. Avoid threaten-
    ing existing self-esteem.
•   Be aware that people are not programmed to be rational.
    They must seek information—choosing to learn; to think
    rather than merely accepting/reacting—in order to have
    respect for self, facts, honesty, and to develop positive self-
    esteem.
•   Discuss client perceptions of self related to what is happening;
    confront misconceptions and negative self-talk. Address
    distortions in thinking, such as self-referencing (belief that
    others are focusing on individual’s weaknesses/limita-
    tions), filtering (focusing on negative and ignoring
    positive), catastrophizing (expecting the worst outcomes).
    Addressing these issues openly provides opportunity for
    change.
•   Emphasize need to avoid comparing self with others.
    Encourage client to focus on aspects of self that can be valued.
•   Have client list current/past successes and strengths.
•   Use positive I-messages rather than praise. Assists client to
    develop internal sense of self-esteem.

    What options are available to the client/SO(s)?
•   Assist client to deal with sense of powerlessness. Refer to ND
    Powerlessness.
•   Set limits on aggressive or problem behaviors such as acting
    out, suicide preoccupation, or rumination. Put self in client’s
    place (empathy not sympathy).
•   Give reinforcement for progress noted. Positive words of
    encouragement support development of coping behaviors.
•   Allow client to progress at own rate. Adaptation to a change
    in self-concept depends on its significance to individ-
    ual, disruption to lifestyle, and length of illness/debilita-
    tion.
•   Assist client to recognize and cope with events, alterations,
    and sense of loss of control by incorporating changes accu-
    rately into self-concept.
•   Involve in activities/exercise program, promote socialization.
    Enhances sense of well-being/can help energize client.

     resources as appropriate. Assists with development of social/
     vocational skills.
   • Encourage participation in classes/activities/hobbies that
     client enjoys or would like to experience.
   • Reinforce that this therapy is a brief encounter in overall
     life of the client/SO(s), with continued work and ongoing
     support being necessary to sustain behavior changes/per-
     sonal growth.
   • Refer to classes to assist with new learning skills to promote

   NURSING PRIORITY NO . 2. To assist client to deal with
   loss/change and recapture sense of positive self-esteem:
   • Assist with treatment of underlying condition when possible.
     For example, cognitive restructuring and improved concen-
     tration in mild brain injury often result in restoration of
     positive self-esteem.
   • Encourage expression of feelings, anxieties. Facilitates griev-
     ing the loss.
   • Active-listen client’s concerns/negative verbalizations without
     comment or judgment.
   • Identify individual strengths/assets and aspects of self that
     remain intact, can be valued. Reinforce positive traits, abili-
     ties, self-view.
   • Help client identify own responsibility and control or lack of
     control in situation.
   • Assist client to problem-solve situation, developing plan of
     action and setting goals to achieve desired outcome. Enhances

Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Determine underlying dynamics of individual situation as
  listed in Related Factors. Note previous episodes of self-muti-
  lation behavior. Although some body piercing (e.g., ears) is
  generally accepted as decorative, piercing of multiple sites
  often is an attempt to establish individuality, addressing
  issues of separation and belonging.
• Identify previous history of self-mutilative behavior and rela-
  tionship to stressful events.
• Determine presence of inflexible, maladaptive personality
  traits that reflect personality/character disorder (e.g., impul-
  sive, unpredictable, inappropriate behaviors, intense anger or
  lack of control of anger).
• Evaluate history of mental illness (e.g., borderline personality,
  identity disorder).
• Note use/abuse of addicting substances.
• Review laboratory findings (e.g., blood alcohol, polydrug
  screen, glucose, and electrolyte levels). Drug use may affect
  behavior.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.      2. To structure environment to main-
tain client safety:
• Assist client to identify feelings leading up to desire for self-
  mutilation. Early recognition of recurring feelings provides
  opportunity to seek other ways of coping.
• Provide external controls/limit setting. May decrease the
  opportunity to self-mutilate.
• Include client in development of plan of care. Commitment
  to plan promotes likelihood of adherence.
• Encourage appropriate expression of feelings. Identifies feel-
  ings and promotes understanding of what leads to develop-
  ment of tension.
• Note feelings of healthcare providers/family, such as frustra-
  tion, anger, defensiveness, need to rescue. Client may be
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                        443


      manipulative, evoking defensiveness and conflict. These feel-
      ings need to be identified, recognized, and dealt with openly
      with staff and client.
   • Provide care for client’s wounds, when self-mutilation
      occurs, in a matter-of-fact manner. Do not offer sympathy
      or additional attention that could provide reinforcement
      for maladaptive behavior and may encourage its repeti-
      tion. A matter-of-fact approach can convey empathy/
      concern.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To promote movement toward posi-
   tive changes:
   • Involve client in developing plan of care. Enhances commit-
      ment to goals, optimizing outcomes.
   • Develop a contract between client and counselor to enable
      the client to stay physically safe, such as “I will not cut or
      harm myself for the next 8 hours.” Renew contract on a
      regular basis and have both parties sign and date each
      contract.
   • Provide avenues of communication for times when client
      needs to talk to avoid cutting or damaging self.
   • Assist client to learn assertive behavior. Include the use of
      effective communication skills, focusing on developing self-
      esteem by replacing negative self-talk with positive
      comments.
   • Use interventions that help the client to reclaim power in own
      life (e.g., experiential and cognitive).
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Discuss commitment to safety and ways in which client will
      deal with precursors to undesired behavior.
   • Promote the use of healthy behaviors, identifying the conse-
      quences and outcomes of current actions.
   • Identify support systems.
   • Discuss living arrangements when client is discharged. May
      need assistance with transition to changes required to avoid
      recurrence of self-mutilating behaviors.
   • Involve family/SO(s) in planning for discharge and involve in
      group therapies as appropriate. Promotes coordination and
      continuation of plan, commitment to goals.
   • Provide information and discuss the use of medication
      as appropriate. Antidepressant medications may be useful,
      but they need to be weighed against the potential for over-
      dosing.

tain client safety:
• Assist client to identify feelings and behaviors that precede
  desire for self-mutilation. Early recognition of recurring feel-
  ings provides client opportunity to seek other ways of
  coping.
• Provide external controls/limit setting to decrease the need to
  self-mutilate.
• Include client in development of plan of care to reestablish
  ego boundaries, strengthen commitment to goals and partic-
  ipation in therapy.
• Encourage client to recognize and appropriately express feel-
  ings verbally.
• Keep client in continuous staff view and do special observa-
  tion checks to promote safety.
• Develop schedule of alternative healthy, success-oriented
  activities, as in groups such as Overeaters Anonymous (OA)
  or similar 12-step program based on individual needs, self-
  esteem activities including positive affirmations, visiting with
  friends, and exercise.
• Structure inpatient milieu to maintain positive, clear, open
  communication among staff and clients, with an understand-
  ing that “secrets are not tolerated” and will be confronted.
• Note feelings of healthcare providers/family, such as frustra-
  tion, anger, defensiveness, distraction, despair and power-
  lessness, need to rescue. Client may be manipulating/
  splitting providers/family members, which evokes defen-
  siveness and resultant conflict. These feelings need to be
  identified, recognized, and dealt with openly with staff and
  client.

tive actions:
• Encourage client involvement in developing plan of care.
   Enhances commitment to goals, optimizing outcomes.
• Assist client to learn assertive behavior rather than
   nonassertive/aggressive behavior. Include use of effective
   communication skills, focusing on developing self-esteem by
   replacing negative self-talk with positive comments.
• Develop a contract between client and counselor to enable the
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                       447


     client to stay physically safe, such as “I will not cut or harm
     myself for the next 8 hours.” Contract is renewed on a regu-
     lar basis and signed and dated by both parties. Contingency
     arrangements need to be made so client can talk to counselor
     as needed.
   • Discuss with client/family normalcy of adolescent task of
     separation and ways of achieving.
   • Promote the use of healthy behaviors, identifying the conse-
     quences and outcomes of current actions: “Does this get you
     what you want?” “How does this behavior help you achieve
     your goals?”
   • Use interventions that help the client to reclaim power in own
     life (e.g., experiential and cognitive).
   • Involve client/family in group therapies as appropriate.

   Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
   Criteria—Client Will:
   • Regain/maintain usual level of cognition.
   • Recognize and correct/compensate for sensory impair-
     ments.
   • Verbalize awareness of sensory needs and presence of over-
     load and/or deprivation.
   • Identify/modify external factors that contribute to alterations
     in sensory/perceptual abilities.
   • Use resources effectively and appropriately.
   • Be free of injury.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.            1. To assess causative/contributing
   factors and degree of impairment:
   • Identify underlying reason for alterations in sensory percep-
     tion, as noted in Related Factors.
   • Be aware of clients at risk for loss/alterations in sensory/
     perceptual senses (e.g., increased intraocular pressure after
     eye surgery), drug toxicity side effects (e.g., halos around
     lights, ringing in ears), middle-ear disturbances (altered sense
     of balance).
   • Review laboratory values (e.g., electrolytes, chemical profile,
     ABGs, serum drug levels).
   • Assess ability to speak and respond to simple commands.
   • Evaluate sensory awareness: Stimulus of hot/cold, dull/sharp;
     awareness of motion, and location of body parts, visual acui-

    indicate decrease in peripheral circulation/cellular catabo-
    lism.
•   Determine response to painful stimuli, to note whether
    response is appropriate to stimulus, immediate, or delayed.
•   Observe for behavioral responses (e.g., illusions/hallucina-
    tions, delusions, withdrawal, hostility, crying, inappropriate
    affect, confusion/disorientation).
•   Ascertain client’s perception of problem/changes.
•   Interview SO(s) regarding his or her observations of changes
    that have occurred/responses of client to changes.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To promote normalization of
response to stimuli:
• Note degree of alteration/involvement (single/multiple
  senses).
• Listen to and respect client’s expressions of deprivation. Take
  these into consideration in planning care.
• Provide means of communication as indicated.
• Provide a stable environment with continuity of care by same
  personnel as much as possible. Have personnel wear name
  tags/reintroduce self as appropriate.
• Avoid isolation of client, physically or emotionally, to prevent
  sensory deprivation/limit confusion.
• Provide feedback to assist client to separate reality from
  fantasy/altered perception.
• Reorient to time, place, staff, and events as necessary (espe-
  cially when vision is impaired).
• Explain procedures/activities, expected sensations, and
  outcomes.
• Minimize discussion of negatives (e.g., client and personnel
  problems) within client’s hearing. Client may misinterpret
  and believe references are to himself/herself.
• Eliminate extraneous noise/stimuli, including nonessential
  equipment, alarms/audible monitor signals when possible.
• Provide undisturbed rest/sleep periods.
• Arrange bed, personal articles, and food trays to take advan-
  tage of functional vision. Enhances independence and
  safety.
• Describe food when client cannot see and assist as neces-
  sary.
• Speak to visually impaired or unresponsive client during care
  to provide auditory stimulation and prevent startle reflex.
• Provide tactile stimulation as care is given. Communicates
  presence/connection with other human being, because
  touching is an important part of caring and a deep psycho-
  logic need.
• Provide sensory stimulation, including familiar smells/
        NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                      451


     sounds, tactile stimulation with a variety of objects, changing
     of light intensity and other cues (e.g., clocks, calendars).
   • Encourage SO(s) to bring in familiar objects, talk to, and
     touch the client frequently.
   • Provide diversional activities as able (e.g., TV/radio, conversa-
     tion, large-print or talking books). (Refer to ND Diversional
     Activity, deficient.)
   • Involve other health-team members in providing stimulating
     modalities, such as music therapy, sensory training, remotiva-
     tion therapy.
   • Identify and encourage use of resources/prosthetic devices
     (e.g., hearing aids, computerized visual aid/glasses with a level
     plumbline for balance). Useful for augmenting senses.
   • Limit/carefully monitor use of sedation, especially in older
     population.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        3. To prevent injury/complications:
   • Place call bell within reach and be sure client knows where it
     is/how to use it.
   • Provide safety measures (e.g., siderails, bed in low position,
     ambulate with assistance). Protect from thermal injury (e.g.,
     monitor use of heating pads/lights, ice packs). Note percep-
     tual deficit on chart so caregivers are aware.
   • Position doors and furniture so they are out of travel path for
     client with impaired vision, or strategically place items/grab
     bars to aid in maintaining balance.
   • Ambulate with assistance/devices to enhance balance.
   • Describe where affected areas of body are when moving the
     client.
   • Limit activities that may increase intraocular pressure when
     indicated: Avoid sudden movement of the head, rubbing eyes,
     bending/stooping, use of bedpan (may be more strain than
     getting up to the bathroom).
   • Monitor drug regimen postsurgically (e.g., antiemetics,
     miotics, sympathomimetics, beta blockers) to prevent
     increase in or to reduce intraocular pressure.
   • Refer to NDs Injury, risk for; Trauma, risk for.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Assist client/SO(s) to learn effective ways of coping with and
     managing sensory disturbances, anticipating safety needs
     according to client’s sensory deficits and developmental level.
   • Identify alternative ways of dealing with perceptual deficits
     (e.g., compensation techniques).
   • Provide explanations of and plan care with client, involving
     SO(s) as much as possible. Enhances commitment to and
     continuation of plan, optimizing outcomes.

OBJECTIVE
Alteration in relationship with SO
Change of interest in self and others
Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
Criteria—Client Will:
• Verbalize understanding of sexual anatomy/function and
  alterations that may affect function.
• Verbalize understanding of individual reasons for sexual
  problems.
• Identify stressors in lifestyle that may contribute to the
  dysfunction.
• Identify satisfying/acceptable sexual practices and some alter-
  native ways of dealing with sexual expression.
• Discuss concerns about body image, sex role, desirability as a
  sexual partner with partner/SO.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Obtain sexual history, including usual pattern of functioning
  and level of desire. Note vocabulary used by the individual to
  maximize communication/understanding.
• Have client describe problem in own words.
• Determine importance of sex to individual/partner and
  client’s motivation for change.
• Be alert to comments of client as sexual concerns are often
  disguised as humor, sarcasm, and/or offhand remarks.
• Assess knowledge of client/SO regarding sexual anatomy/
  function and effects of current situation/condition.
• Determine preexisting problems that may be factors in
  current situation (e.g., marital/job stress, role conflicts).
• Identify current stress factors in individual situation. These
  factors may be producing enough anxiety to cause depres-
  sion or other psychologic reaction(s) that would cause phys-
  iologic symptoms.
• Discuss cultural/religious value factors or conflicts present.
• Determine pathophysiology, illness/surgery/trauma involved,
  and impact on (perception of) individual/SO.
• Review medication regimen/drug use (prescription, OTC,
  illegal, alcohol) and cigarette use. Antihypertensives may
  cause erectile dysfunction; MAO inhibitors and tricyclics can
  cause erection/ejaculation problems and anorgasmia in
  women; narcotics/alcohol produce impotence and inhibit
  orgasm; smoking creates vasoconstriction and may be a
  factor in erectile dysfunction.

   • Observe behavior/stage of grieving when related to body
     changes or loss of a body part (e.g., pregnancy, obesity, ampu-
     tation, mastectomy).
   • Assist with diagnostic studies to determine cause of erectile
     dysfunction. (More than half of the cases have a physical
     cause such as diabetes, vascular problems, etc.) Monitor
     penile tumescence during REM sleep to assist in determining
     physical ability.
   • Explore with client the meaning of client’s behavior.
     (Masturbation, for instance, may have many meanings/
     purposes, such as for relief of anxiety, sexual deprivation,
     pleasure, a nonverbal expression of need to talk, way of alien-
     ating.)
   • Avoid making value judgments as they do not help the client
     to cope with the situation. Note: Nurse needs to be aware of
     and be in control of own feelings and response to client
     expressions and/or concerns.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.         2. To assist client/SO(s) to deal with
   individual situation:

     including changes in medication regimen, weight manage-
     ment, cessation of smoking, and so forth.
   • Provide factual information about individual condition
     involved. Promotes informed decision making.
   • Determine what client wants to know to tailor information
     to client needs. Note: Information affecting client
     safety/consequences of actions may need to be reviewed/rein-
     forced.
   • Encourage and accept expressions of concern, anger, grief,
     fear.
   • Assist client to be aware/deal with stages of grieving for
     loss/change.
   • Encourage client to share thoughts/concerns with partner and
     to clarify values/impact of condition on relationship.
   • Provide for/identify ways to obtain privacy to allow for sexual
     expression for individual and/or between partners without
     embarrassment and/or objections of others.
   • Assist client/SO(s) to problem-solve alternative ways of sexual
     expression.
   • Provide information about availability of corrective measures
     such as medication (e.g., papaverine or sildenafil—Viagra—
     for erectile dysfunction) or reconstructive surgery (e.g.,

   Criteria—Client Will:
   • Display timely healing of skin lesions/wounds/pressure sores
     without complication.
   • Maintain optimal nutrition/physical well-being.
   • Participate in prevention measures and treatment program.
   • Verbalize feelings of increased self-esteem and ability to
     manage situation.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.            1. To assess causative/contributing
   factors:
   • Identify underlying condition/pathology involved (e.g., skin
     and other cancers, burns, scleroderma, lupus, psoriasis, acne,
     diabetes, occupational hazards, steroid therapy, familial
     history, trauma, surgical incision/amputation, radiation ther-
     apy, communicable diseases).
   • Note general debilitation, reduced mobility, changes in
     skin/muscle mass associated with aging/chronic disease, pres-
     ence of incontinence/problems with self-care.
   • Assess blood supply and sensation (nerve damage) of affected
     area.
   • Determine nutritional status and areas at risk for injury
     because of malnutrition (e.g., pressure points on emaciated
     and/or elderly client).
   • Evaluate risks for injury (e.g., the use of restraints, long-term
     immobility).
   • Note laboratory results pertinent to causative factors (e.g.,
     studies such as Hb/Hct, blood glucose, albumin/protein).
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assess extent of involvement/
   injury:
   • Obtain a history of condition, including age at onset, date of
     first episode, how long it lasted, original site, characteristics of
     lesions, and any changes that have occurred.
   • Note changes in skin color, texture, and turgor. Assess areas
     of least pigmentation for color changes (e.g., sclera, conjunc-
     tiva, nailbeds, buccal mucosa, tongue, palms, and soles of
     feet).
   • Palpate skin lesions for size, shape, consistency, texture,
     temperature, and hydration.
   • Determine depth of injury/damage to integumentary system
     (epidermis, dermis, and/or underlying tissues).
   • Measure length, width, depth of ulcers. Note extent of tunnel-
     ing/undermining, if present.
   • Inspect surrounding skin for erythema, induration, macer-
     ation.

• Photograph lesion(s) as appropriate to document status/
                                                                       Skin Integrity, impaired
  provide visual baseline for future comparisons.
• Note odors emitted from the skin/area of injury.
• Classify ulcer using tool such as Wagner Ulcer Classification
  System. Provides consistent terminology for documentation.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.    3. To determine impact of condition:
• Ascertain attitudes of individual/SO(s) about condition (e.g.,
  cultural values, stigma). Note misconceptions. Identifies
  areas to be addressed in teaching plan and potential referral
  needs.
• Obtain psychologic assessment of client’s emotional status,
  noting potential or sexual problems arising from presence of
  condition.
• Note presence of compromised vision, hearing, or speech.
  Skin is a particularly important avenue of communication
  for these people and, when compromised, may affect
  responses.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To assist client with correcting/mini-
mizing condition and promote optimal healing:
• Inspect skin on a daily basis, describing lesions and changes
  observed.
• Periodically remeasure/photograph wound and observe for
  complications (e.g., infection, dehiscence) to monitor pro-
  gress of wound healing.
• Keep the area clean/dry, carefully dress wounds, support inci-
  sion (e.g., use of Steri-Strips, splinting when coughing),
  prevent infection, and stimulate circulation to surrounding
  areas to assist body’s natural process of repair.
• Assist with débridement/enzymatic therapy as indicated (e.g.,
  burns, severe pressures sores).
• Use appropriate barrier dressings, wound coverings, drainage
  appliances, and skin-protective agents for open/draining
  wounds and stomas to protect the wound and/or surround-
  ing tissues. Expose lesions/ulcer to air and light as indicated.
• Limit/avoid use of plastic material (e.g., rubber sheet, plastic-
  backed linen savers). Remove wet/wrinkled linens promptly.
  Moisture potentiates skin breakdown.
• Develop repositioning schedule for client, involving client in
  reasons for and decisions about times and positions in
  conjunction with other activities to enhance understanding
  and cooperation.
• Use appropriate padding devices (e.g., air/water mattress,
  sheepskin) when indicated to reduce pressure on/enhance
  circulation to compromised tissues.
• Encourage early ambulation/mobilization. Promotes circula-
  tion and reduces risks associated with immobility.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                        463


   • Calculate ankle-brachial index for clients with potential for/
     actual impairment of circulation to lower extremities. Result
     less than 0.9 indicates need for close monitoring/more
     aggressive intervention (e.g., tighter blood glucose and
     weight control in diabetic client).
   • Obtain specimen from draining wounds when appropriate
     for culture/sensitivities/Gram’s stain to determine appropri-
     ate therapy.
   • Provide optimum nutrition and increased protein intake to
     provide a positive nitrogen balance to aid in healing and to
     maintain general good health.
   • Monitor periodic laboratory studies relative to general well-
     being and status of specific problem.
   • Consult with wound specialist as indicated to assist with
     developing plan of care for problematic or potentially seri-
     ous wounds.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 5. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Review importance of skin and measures to maintain proper
     skin functioning.
   • Discuss importance of early detection of skin changes and/or
     complications.
   • Assist the client/SO(s) in understanding and following
     medical regimen and developing program of preventive care
     and daily maintenance. Enhances commitment to plan, opti-
     mizing outcomes.
   • Review measures to avoid spread/reinfection of communica-
     ble disease/conditions.
   • Emphasize importance of proper fit of clothing/shoes, use of
     specially lined shock-absorbing socks or pressure-reducing
     insoles for shoes in presence of reduced sensation/circula-
     tion.
   • Identify safety factors for use of equipment/appliances (e.g.,
     heating pad, ostomy appliances, padding straps of braces).
   • Encourage client to verbalize feelings and discuss how/if
     condition affects self-concept/self-esteem. (Refer to NDs
     Body Image, disturbed, Self-Esteem, situational low.)
   • Assist client to work through stages of grief and feelings asso-
     ciated with individual condition.
   • Lend psychologic support and acceptance of client, using
     touch, facial expressions, and tone of voice.
   • Assist client to learn stress reduction and alternate therapy
     techniques to control feelings of helplessness and deal with
     situation.
   • Refer to dietitian or certified diabetes educator as appropriate
     to enhance healing, reduce risk of recurrence of diabetic
     ulcers.

factors:
• Determine presence of physical or psychological stressors,
  including night-shift working hours, pain, advanced age,
  current/recent illness, death of a spouse.
• Note medical diagnoses that affect sleep (e.g., dementia,
  encephalitis, brain injury, narcolepsy, depression, asthma,
  sleep-induced respiratory disorders/obstructive sleep apnea,
  nocturnal myoclonus).
• Evaluate for use of medications and/or other drugs affecting
  sleep (e.g., diet pills, antidepressives, antihypertensives, alco-
  hol, stimulants, sedatives, diuretics, narcotics).
• Note environmental factors affecting sleep (e.g., unfamiliar or
  uncomfortable sleep environment, excessive noise and light,
  uncomfortable temperature, roommate irritations/actions—
  e.g., snoring, watching TV late at night).
• Determine presence of parasomnias: nightmares/terrors or
  somnambulism (e.g., sitting, sleepwalking, or other complex
  behavior during sleep).
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                             469


   • Note reports of terror, brief periods of paralysis, sense of body
      being disconnected from the brain. Occurrence of sleep
      paralysis, though not widely recognized in the United States,
      has been well documented elsewhere and may result in
      feelings of fear/reluctance to go to sleep.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        2. To assess degree of impairment:
   • Determine client’s usual sleep pattern and expectations.
      Provides comparative baseline.
   • Ascertain duration of current problem and effect on life/func-
      tional ability.
   • Listen to subjective reports of sleep quality.
   • Observe physical signs of fatigue (e.g., restlessness, reports
      of feeling not rested or being exhausted, irritability,
      changes in behavior/performance, disorientation, frequent
      yawning).
   • Determine interventions client has tried to date. Helps iden-
      tify appropriate options.
   • Distinguish client’s beneficial bedtime habits from detrimen-
      tal ones (e.g., drinking late-evening milk versus drinking late-
      evening coffee).
   • Instruct client and/or bed partner to keep a sleep-wake log to
      document symptoms and identify factors that are interfering
      with sleep.
   • Do a chronological chart to determine peak performance
      rhythms.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.         3. To assist client to establish optimal
   sleep pattern:
   • Encourage client to develop plan to restrict caffeine, alcohol,
      and other stimulating substances from late afternoon/evening
      intake, and avoid eating large evening/late-night meals. These
      factors are known to disrupt sleep patterns.
   • Recommend bedtime snack (protein, simple carbohydrate,
      and low fat) for young children 15 to 30 minutes before retir-
      ing. Sense of fullness and satiety promotes sleep and reduces
      likelihood of gastric upset.
   • Promote adequate physical exercise activity during day.
      Enhances expenditure of energy/release of tension so that
      client feels ready for sleep/rest.
   • Review medications being taken and their effect on sleep,
      suggesting modifications in regimen, if medications are
      found to be interfering.
   • Suggest abstaining from daytime naps because they impair
      ability to sleep at night.
   • Investigate anxious feelings to help determine basis and
      appropriate anxiety-reduction techniques.
   • Recommend quiet activities, such as reading/listening to
70 N U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E


    soothing music in the evening, to reduce stimulation so client
                                                                           Sleep Deprivation
    can relax.
•   Instruct in relaxation techniques, music therapy, meditation,
    and so forth to decrease tension, prepare for rest/sleep.
•   Limit evening fluid intake if nocturia is present to reduce
    need for nighttime elimination.
•   Discuss/implement effective age-appropriate bedtime ritu-
    als (e.g., going to bed at same time each night, drinking
    warm milk, rocking, story reading, cuddling, favorite blan-
    ket/toy) to enhance client’s ability to fall asleep, reinforce that
    bed is a place to sleep, and promote sense of security for
    child.
•   Provide calm, quiet environment and manage controllable
    sleep-disrupting factors (e.g., noise, light, room temperature).
•   Administer sedatives/other sleep medications when indicated,
    noting client’s response. Time pain medications for peak
    effect/duration to reduce need for redosing during prime
    sleep hours.
•   Instruct client to get out of bed, leave bedroom, engage in
    relaxing activities if unable to fall asleep, and not return to
    bed until feeling sleepy.
•   Review with the client the physician’s recommendations for
    medications or surgery (alteration of facial structures/
    tracheotomy) and/or apneic oxygenation therapy—continu-
    ous positive airway pressure (CPAP) such as Respironics—
    when sleep apnea is severe as documented by sleep disorder
    studies.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
Discharge Considerations):
• Review possibility of next-day drowsiness/“rebound” insom-
  nia and temporary memory loss that may be associated with
  prescription sleep medications.
• Discuss use/appropriateness of OTC sleep medications/herbal
  supplements. Note possible side effects and drug interactions.
• Refer to support group/counselor to help deal with psycho-
  logic stressors (e.g., grief, sorrow). Refer to NDs Grieving,

   Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
   Criteria—Client Will:
   • Verbalize understanding of sleep disturbance.
   • Identify individually appropriate interventions to promote
     sleep.
   • Adjust lifestyle to accommodate chronobiological rhythms.
   • Report improvement in sleep/rest pattern.
   • Report increased sense of well-being and feeling rested.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 1. To identify causative/contributing
   factors:
   • Identify presence of factors as listed in Related Factors,
     including factors that can contribute to insomnia (such as
     chronic pain); metabolic diseases (such as hyperthyroidism
     and diabetes); prescribed/OTC drug use; aging (a high
     percentage of elderly are affected by sleep problems).
   • Assess sleep pattern disturbances that are associated with
     specific underlying illnesses (e.g., nocturia occurring with
     benign prostatic hypertrophy).
   • Observe parent-infant interactions/provision of emotional
     support. Note mother’s sleep-wake pattern. Lack of knowl-
     edge of infant cues/problem relationships may create tension
     interfering with sleep. Structured sleep routines based on
     adult schedules may not meet child’s needs.
   • Ascertain presence/frequency of enuresis.
   • Review psychologic assessment, noting individual and
     personality characteristics.
   • Determine recent traumatic events in client’s life (e.g., a death
     in family, loss of job).
   • Evaluate use of caffeine and alcoholic beverages (overindul-
     gence interferes with REM sleep).
   • Assist with diagnostic testing (e.g., EEG, sleep studies).
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.             2. To evaluate sleep pattern and
   dysfunction(s):
   • Observe and/or obtain feedback from client/SO(s) regarding
     usual bedtime, rituals/routines, number of hours of sleep,
     time of arising, and environmental needs to determine usual
     sleep pattern and provide comparative baseline.
   • Determine client’s/SO’s expectations of adequate sleep.
     Provides opportunity to address misconceptions/unrealistic
     expectations.
   • Investigate whether client snores and in what position(s) this
     occurs.
   • Listen to subjective reports of sleep quality.
   • Identify circumstances that interrupt sleep and frequency.

• Note alteration of habitual sleep time such as change of work
                                                                        Sleep Pattern, disturbed
  pattern/rotating shifts, change in normal bedtime (hospital-
  ization).
• Observe physical signs of fatigue (e.g., restlessness, hand
  tremors, thick speech).
• Do a chronological chart to determine peak performance
  rhythm.
• Graph “circadian” rhythms of individual’s biological internal
  chemistry per protocol as indicated. (Note: Studies have
  shown sleep cycles are affected by body temperature at onset
  of sleep.)
NURSING PRIORITY NO.      3. To assist client to establish optimal
sleep/rest patterns:
• Arrange care to provide for uninterrupted periods for rest,
   especially allowing for longer periods of sleep at night when
   possible. Do as much care as possible without waking client.
• Explain necessity of disturbances for monitoring vital signs
   and/or other care when client is hospitalized.
• Provide quiet environment and comfort measures (e.g., back
   rub, washing hands/face, cleaning and straightening sheets) in
   preparation for sleep.
• Discuss/implement effective age-appropriate bedtime rituals
   (e.g., going to bed at same time each night, drinking warm
   milk, rocking, story reading, cuddling, favorite blanket/toy) to
   enhance client’s ability to fall asleep, reinforce that bed is a
   place to sleep, and promote sense of security for child.
• Recommend limiting intake of chocolate and caffeine/alco-
   holic beverages, especially prior to bedtime.
• Limit fluid intake in evening if nocturia is a problem to
   reduce need for nighttime elimination.
• Explore other sleep aids (e.g., warm bath/milk, protein intake
   before bedtime).
• Administer pain medications (if required) 1 hour before sleep
   to relieve discomfort and take maximum advantage of seda-
   tive effect.
• Monitor effects of drug regimen—amphetamines or stimu-
   lants (e.g., Methylphenidate—Ritalin used in narcolepsy).
• Use barbiturates and/or other sleeping medications sparingly.
   Research indicates long-term use of these medications can
   actually induce sleep disturbances.
• Develop behavioral program for insomnia:
     Establish routine bedtime and arising.
     Think relaxing thoughts when in bed.
     Do not nap in the daytime.
     Do not read in bed; get out of bed if not asleep in 15 minutes.
     Limit sleep to 7 hours a night.
     Get up the same time each day—even on weekends/days off.

   • Assure client that occasional sleeplessness should not threaten
     health.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Assist client to develop individual program of relaxation.
     Demonstrate techniques (e.g., biofeedback, self-hypnosis,
     visualization, progressive muscle relaxation).
   • Encourage participation in regular exercise program during
     day to aid in stress control/release of energy. Exercise at
     bedtime may stimulate rather than relax client and actually
     interfere with sleep.
   • Recommend inclusion of bedtime snack (e.g., milk or mild
     juice, crackers, protein source such as cheese/peanut butter)
     in dietary program to reduce sleep interference from
     hunger/hypoglycemia.
   • Suggest that bed/bedroom be used only for sleep, not for
     working, watching TV.
   • Provide for child’s (or impaired individual’s) sleep time safety
     (e.g., infant placed on back, bedrails/bed in low position,
     nonplastic sheets).
   • Investigate use of aids to block out light/noise, such as sleep
     mask, darkening shades/curtains, earplugs, monotonous
     sounds such as low-level background noise (white noise).
   • Participate in program to “reset” the body’s sleep clock
     (chronotherapy) when client has delayed sleep-onset in-
     somnia.
   • Assist individual to develop schedules that take advantage of
     peak performance times as identified in chronobiological
     chart.
   • Recommend midmorning nap if one is required. Napping,
     especially in the afternoon, can disrupt normal sleep
     patterns.
   • Assist client to deal with grieving process when loss has
     occurred. (Refer to ND Grieving, dysfunctional.)
   • Refer to sleep specialist/laboratory for treatment when indi-
     cated.

   • Verbalize feeling rested after sleep.
   • Adjust lifestyle to accommodate routines that promote sleep.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To determine motivation for contin-
   ued growth:
   • Listen to client’s reports of sleep quantity and quality.
     Determine client’s/SO’s expectations of adequate sleep.
     Reveals client’s experience and expectations. Provides oppor-
     tunity to address misconceptions/unrealistic expectations
     and plan for interventions.
   • Observe and/or obtain feedback from client/SO(s) regarding
     usual bedtime, desired rituals and routines, number of hours
     of sleep, time of arising, and environmental needs to deter-
     mine usual sleep pattern and provide comparative baseline
     for improvements.
   • Note client report of potential for alteration of habitual sleep
     time (e.g., change of work pattern/rotating shifts) or change
     in normal bedtime (e.g., hospitalization). Helps identify
     circumstances that are known to interrupt sleep patterns and
     which could disrupt the person’s biological rhythms.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        2. To assist client to enhance sleep/rest:
   • Discuss adult client’s usual bedtime rituals, expectations for
     obtaining good sleep time. Provides information on client’s
     management of the situation and identifies areas that might
     be modified.
   • Discuss/implement effective age-appropriate bedtime rituals
     for infant/child (e.g., rocking, story reading, cuddling, favorite
     blanket/toy). Rituals can enhance ability to fall asleep, rein-
     forces that bed is a place to sleep and promote sense of secu-
     rity for child.
   • Assist client in use of necessary equipment, instructing as
     necessary. Client may use oxygen or CPAP system to improve
     sleep/rest if hypoxia or sleep apnea diagnosed.
   • Investigate use of sleep mask, darkening shades/curtains,
     earplugs, low-level background (white) noise. Aids in block-
     ing out light and disturbing noise.
   • Arrange care to provide for uninterrupted periods for rest.
     Explain necessity of disturbances for monitoring vital signs
     and/or other care when client is hospitalized. Do as much care
     as possible without waking client, during night. Allows for
     longer periods of uninterrupted sleep, especially during
     night.
   • Provide quiet environment and comfort measures (e.g., back
     rub, washing hands/face, cleaning and straightening sheets).
     Promotes relaxation and readiness for sleep.

• Explore/implement use of warm bath, comfortable room
                                                                       Sleep, readiness for enhanced
  temperature, use of soothing music, favorite calming TV
  show. Nonpharmaceutical aids may enhance falling asleep.
• Recommend limiting intake of chocolate and caffeine/alco-
  holic beverages, especially prior to bedtime. Substances
  known to impair falling or staying asleep. Use of alcohol at
  bedtime may help individual fall asleep, but ensuing sleep is
  then fragmented.
• Limit fluid intake in evening if nocturia or bedwetting is a
  problem to reduce need for nighttime elimination.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.     3. To promote optimum wellness:
• Assure client that occasional sleeplessness should not threaten
  health. Knowledge that occasional insomnia is universal and
  usually not harmful, may promote relaxation and relief from
  worry.
• Encourage client to develop individual program of relaxation
  (e.g., biofeedback, self-hypnosis, visualization, progressive
  muscle relaxation). Methods that reduce sympathetic
  response and decrease stress can help in inducing sleep,
  particularly in persons suffering from chronic and long-term
  sleep disturbances.
• Encourage participation in regular exercise program during
  day to aid in stress control/release of energy. Note: Exercise at
  bedtime may stimulate rather than relax client and actually
  interfere with sleep.
• Recommend inclusion of bedtime snack (e.g., milk or mild
  juice, crackers, protein source, such as cheese/peanut butter)
  in dietary program to reduce sleep interference from
  hunger/hypoglycemia.
• Advise using barbiturates and/or other sleeping medications
  sparingly. These medications, while useful for promoting
  sleep in the short-term, can interfere with REM sleep.

NURSING PRIORITY NO.         1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Review social history with client/SO(s) and go back far
  enough in time to note when changes in social behavior or
  patterns of relating occurred/began, for example, loss or long-
  term illness of loved one; failed relationships; loss of occupa-
  tion, financial, or political (power) position; change in status
  in family hierarchy (job loss, aging, illness); poor coping/
  adjustment to developmental stage of life, as with marriage,
  birth/adoption of child, or children leaving home.
• Ascertain ethnic/cultural or religious implications for the
  client because these impact choice of behaviors.
• Review medical history noting stressors of physical/long-term
  illness (e.g., stroke, cancer, MS, head injury, Alzheimer’s
  disease), mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia), medications/
  drugs, debilitating accidents.
• Determine family patterns of relating and social behaviors.
  Explore possible family scripting of behavioral expectations
  in the children and how the client was affected. (May result in
  conforming or rebellious behaviors.)
• Observe client while relating to family/SO(s) and note obser-
  vations of prevalent patterns.
• Encourage client to verbalize feeling of discomfort about
  social situations. Note any causative factors, recurring precip-
  itating patterns, and barriers to using support systems.
• Note effects of changes on socioeconomic level, ethnic/reli-
  gious practices.

     (directed or not).
   • Observe and describe social/interpersonal behaviors in objec-
     tive terms, noting speech patterns, body language (a) in the
     therapeutic setting and (b) in normal areas of daily function-
     ing (if possible): family, job, social/entertainment settings.
   • Determine client’s use of coping skills and defense mecha-
     nisms. (Affects ability to be involved in social situations.)
   • Evaluate possibility of client being the victim of or using
     destructive behaviors against self or others. (Refer to ND
     Violence, [actual/]risk for other-directed/self-directed.)
   • Interview family, SO(s), friends, spiritual leaders, coworkers,
     as appropriate, to obtain observations of client’s behavioral
     changes.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To assist client/SO(s) to recognize/
   make positive changes in impaired social and interpersonal
   interactions:
   • Establish therapeutic relationship using positive regard for
     the person, Active-listening, and providing safe environment
     for self-disclosure.
   • Have client list behaviors that cause discomfort. Once recog-
     nized, client can choose to change.
   • Have family/SO(s) list client’s behaviors that are causing
     discomfort for them.
   • Review/list negative behaviors observed previously by care-
     givers, coworkers, and so forth.
   • Compare lists and validate reality of perceptions. Help client
     prioritize those behaviors needing change.
   • Explore with client and role-play means of making changes in
     social interactions/behaviors (as determined earlier).
   • Role-play random social situations in therapeutically
     controlled environment with “safe” therapy group. Have
     group note behaviors, both positive and negative, and discuss
     these and any changes needed.
   • Role-play changes and discuss impact. Include family/SO(s)
     as indicated. Enhances comfort with new behaviors.
   • Provide positive reinforcement for improvement in social
     behaviors and interactions. Encourages continuation of
     desired behaviors/efforts for change.
   • Participate in multidisciplinary client-centered conferences to
     evaluate progress. Involve everyone associated with client’s
     care, family members, SO(s), and therapy group.
   • Work with the client to alleviate underlying negative self-
     concepts because they often impede positive social interac-
     tions.
   • Involve neurologically impaired client in individual and/or
     group interactions as situation allows.

• Encourage client to keep a daily journal in which social inter-
  actions of each day can be reviewed and the comfort/discom-
  fort experienced noted with possible causes/precipitating
  factors. Helps client to identify responsibility for own be-
  havior(s).
• Assist the client to develop positive social skills through prac-
  tice of skills in real social situations accompanied by a support
  person. Provide positive feedback during interactions with
  client.
• Seek community programs for client involvement that
  promote positive behaviors the client is striving to achieve.
• Encourage classes, reading materials, community support
  groups, and lectures for self-help in alleviating negative self-
  concepts that lead to impaired social interactions.
• Encourage ongoing family or individual therapy as long as it
  is promoting growth and positive change. (Be alert to possi-
  bility of therapy being used as a crutch.)

Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.         1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Determine client’s religious/spiritual orientation, current
  involvement, presence of conflicts. Individual spiritual prac-
  tices/restrictions may affect client care or create conflict
  between spiritual beliefs and treatment.
• Listen to client/SO’s reports/expressions of anger/concern,
  alienation from God, belief that illness/situation is a punish-
  ment for wrongdoing, and so forth. Identifies need for spiri-
  tual advisor to address client’s belief system.

  lessness, lack of motivation to help self. Indicators that client
  may see no, or only limited, options/alternatives or personal
  choices available and lacks energy to deal with situation.

  for living. Evaluate suicidal ideation. Crisis of the spirit/loss
  of will-to-live places client at increased risk for inattention to
  personal well-being/harm to self.

  others/creative or religious activities, dependence on alco-
  hol/medications). Helpful in determining severity/duration
  of situation and possible need for additional referrals, such

  is used for management of client’s sense of powerlessness
  because of distrust of others.

  they are used. Provides insight to client’s willingness to
  pursue outside resources.

   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To determine spiritual state/motiva-
   tion for growth:
   • Ascertain client’s perception of current state/degree of
     connectedness and expectations. Provides insight as to where
     client is currently and what hopes for the future may be.
   • Review spiritual/religious history, activities/rituals and
     frequency of participation. Provides basis to build on for
     growth/change.
   • Determine relational values of support systems to one’s
     spiritual centeredness. The client’s family of origin may
     have differing beliefs from those espoused by the indi-
     vidual that may be a source of conflict for the client. Com-
     fort can be gained when family and friends share client’s
     beliefs and support search for spiritual knowledge.
   • Explore meaning/interpretation and relationship of spiri-
     tuality, life/death, and illness to life’s journey. Identifying
     the meaning of these issues is helpful for the client to
     use the information in forming a belief system that will
     enable him or her to move forward and live life to the
     fullest.
   • Clarify the meaning of one’s spiritual beliefs/religious practice
     and rituals to daily living. Discussing these issues allows
     client to explore spiritual needs and decide what fits own
     view of the world to enhance life.
   • Explore ways that spirituality/religious practices have affected
     one’s life and given meaning and value to daily living. Note
     consequences as well as benefits. Understanding that there is
     a difference between spirituality and religion and how each
     can be useful will help the client begin to use the information
     in the most useful ways.
   • Discuss life’s/God’s plan for the individual. Helpful in deter-
     mining individual goals/choosing specific options.

• Explore ways beliefs give meaning and value to daily living. As
  client develops understanding of these issues, they will
  provide support for dealing with current/future concerns.
• Clarify reality/appropriateness of client’s self-perceptions and
  expectations. Necessary to provide firm foundation for
  growth.
• Determine influence of cultural beliefs/values. Most individ-
  uals are strongly influenced by the spiritual/religious orien-
  tation of their family of origin, which can be a very strong
  determinate for client’s choice of activities/receptiveness to
  various options.
• Discuss the importance and value of connections to one’s
  daily life. The contact that one has with others maintains a
  feeling of belonging and connection and promotes feelings of
  wholeness and well-being.
• Identify ways to achieve connectedness or harmony with self,
  others, nature, higher power (e.g., meditation, prayer, talk-
  ing/sharing oneself with others; being out in nature/garden-
  ing/walking; attending religious activities). This is a highly
  individual and personal decision, and no action is too trivial
  to be considered.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.    3. To enhance optimum wellness:
• Encourage client to take time to be introspective in the search
  for peace and harmony. Finding peace within oneself will
  carry over to relationships with others and one’s outlook on
  life.
• Discuss use of relaxation/meditative activities (e.g., yoga, tai
  chi, prayer). Helpful in promoting general well-being and
  sense of connectedness with self/nature/spiritual power.
• Suggest attendance/involvement in dream-sharing group to
  develop/enhance learning of the characteristics of spiritual
  awareness and facilitate the individual’s growth.
• Identify ways for spiritual/religious expression. There are
  multiple options for enhancing spirituality through connect-
  edness with self/others (e.g., volunteering time to commu-
  nity projects, mentoring, singing in the choir, painting, or
  spiritual writings).
• Encourage participation in desired religious activities, contact
  with minister/spiritual advisor. Validating one’s beliefs in an
  external way can provide support and strengthen the inner
  self.
• Discuss and role-play, as necessary, ways to deal with alterna-
  tive view/conflict that may occur with family/SO(s)/
  society/cultural group. Provides opportunity to try out

• Identify degree of risk/potential for suicide and seriousness of
                                                                       Suicide, risk for
  threat. Use a scale of 1 to 10 and prioritize according to sever-
  ity of threat, availability of means. (Risk of suicide is greater
  in teens and the elderly, but there is a rising awareness of risk
  in early childhood.)
• Note behaviors indicative of intent (e.g., gestures, presence
  of means, such as guns, threats, giving away possessions,
  previous attempts, and presence of hallucinations or delu-
  sions).
• Ask directly if person is thinking of acting on thoughts/feel-
  ings to determine intent.
• Reevaluate potential for suicide periodically at key times (e.g.,
  mood changes, increasing withdrawal), as well as when client
  is feeling better and discharge planning becomes active. The
  highest risk is when the client has both suicidal ideation and
  sufficient energy with which to act.
• Determine presence of SO(s)/friends who are available for
  support.
• Note withdrawal from usual activities, lack of social interac-
  tions.
• Identify conditions, such as acute/chronic brain syndrome;
  panic state; hormonal imbalance (e.g., PMS, postpartum
  psychosis, drug-induced) that may interfere with ability to
  control own behavior.
• Review laboratory findings (e.g., blood alcohol, blood
  glucose, ABGs, electrolytes, renal function tests), to identify
  factors that may affect reasoning ability.
• Assess physical complaints (e.g., sleeping difficulties, lack of
  appetite).
• Note family history of suicidal behavior. (Individual risk is
  increased.)
• Assess coping behaviors presently used. Note: Client may
  believe there is no alternative except suicide.
• Determine drug use, involvement with judicial system.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assist clients to accept responsibil-
ity for own behavior and prevent suicide:
• Develop therapeutic nurse-client relationship, providing
   consistent caregiver. Promotes sense of trust, allowing indi-
   vidual to discuss feelings openly.
• Maintain straightforward communication to avoid reinforc-
   ing manipulative behavior.
• Explain concern for safety and willingness to help client stay
   safe.
• Encourage expression of feelings and make time to listen to
   concerns. Acknowledges reality of feelings and that they are
   OK. Helps individual sort out thinking and begin to develop
   understanding of situation.
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                        505


   • Give permission to express angry feelings in acceptable ways
     and let client know someone will be available to assist in
     maintaining control. Promotes acceptance and sense of
     safety.
   • Acknowledge reality of suicide as an option. Discuss conse-
     quences of actions if they follow through on intent. Ask
     how it will help individual to resolve problems. Helps to
     focus on consequences of actions and possibility of other
     options.
   • Maintain observation of client and check environment for
     hazards that could be used to commit suicide to increase
     client safety/reduce risk of impulsive behavior.
   • Help client identify more appropriate solutions/behaviors
     (e.g., motor activities/exercise) to lessen sense of anxiety and
     associated physical manifestations.
   • Provide directions for actions client can take, avoiding nega-
     tive statements, such as “do nots.” Promotes a positive atti-
     tude.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.          3. To assist client to plan course of
   action to correct/deal with existing situation:
   • Gear interventions to individual involved (e.g., age, relation-
     ship, and current situation).
   • Negotiate contract with client regarding willingness not to do
     anything lethal for a stated period of time. Specify what care-
     giver will be responsible for and what client responsibilities
     are.
   • Specify alternative actions necessary if client is unwilling to
     negotiate contract.
   • Discuss losses client has experienced and meaning of those
     losses. Unresolved issues may be contributing to thoughts of
     hopelessness.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 4. To promote wellness (Teaching/
   Discharge Considerations):
   • Promote development of internal control by helping client
     look at new ways to deal with problems.
   • Assist with learning problem solving, assertiveness training,
     and social skills.
   • Engage in physical activity programs. Promotes feelings of
     self-worth and improves sense of well-being.
   • Determine nutritional needs and help client to plan for meet-
     ing them.
   • Involve family/SO in planning to improve understanding and
     support.
   • Refer to formal resources as indicated (e.g., individual/group/
     marital psychotherapy, substance abuse treatment program,
     and social services).

  managing the food when one side of the mouth is affected by
  the condition (e.g., hemiplegia).
• Suction oral cavity prn. Teach client self-suction when appro-
  priate. Promotes independence/sense of control.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To enhance swallowing ability to
meet fluid and caloric body requirements:
• Refer to gastroenterologist as indicated. (Esophageal dilata-
  tion may be necessary when impaired sphincter function or
  esophageal strictures impede swallowing.)
• Refer to speech therapist to identify specific techniques to
  enhance client efforts/safety measures as indicated.
• Provide cognitive cues (e.g., remind client to chew/swallow as
  indicated) to enhance concentration and performance of
  swallowing sequence.
• Encourage a rest period before meals to minimize fatigue.
• Provide analgesics prior to feeding as indicated to enhance
  comfort, being cautious to avoid decreasing awareness/
  sensory perception.
• Focus attention on feeding/swallowing activity and decreas-
  ing environmental stimuli, which may be distracting during
  feeding.
• Determine food preferences of client to incorporate as possi-
  ble enhancing intake. Present foods in an appealing, attractive
  manner.
• Ensure temperature (hot or cold versus tepid) of foods/fluid,
  which will stimulate sensory receptors.
• Provide a consistency of food/fluid that is most easily swal-
  lowed (can be formed into a bolus before swallowing), such as
  gelatin desserts prepared with less water than usual, pudding,
  and custard; thickened liquids (addition of thickening agent,
  or yogurt, cream soups prepared with less water); thinned
  purees (hot cereal with water added); or thick drinks, such as
  nectars; fruit juices that have been frozen into “slush” consis-
  tency (thin fluids are most difficult to control); medium-soft
  boiled or scrambled eggs; canned fruit; soft-cooked vegeta-
  bles. Avoid milk products and chocolate, which may thicken
  oral secretions.
• Feed one consistency and/or texture of food at a time.
• Place food midway in oral cavity; provide medium-sized bites
  (about 15 mL) to adequately trigger the swallowing reflex.
• Instruct to chew food on unaffected side as appropriate.
• Massage the laryngopharyngeal musculature (sides of trachea
  and neck) gently to stimulate swallowing.
• Observe oral cavity after each bite and have client check
  around cheeks with tongue for remaining food. Remove food
  if unable to swallow.

   • Incorporate client’s eating style and pace when feeding to
     avoid fatigue and frustration with process.
   • Allow ample time for eating (feeding).
   • Remain with client during meal to reduce anxiety and offer
     assistance.
   • Use a glass with a nose cutout to avoid posterior head tilting
     while drinking. Never pour liquid into the mouth. Avoid
     “washing food down” with liquid.
   • Monitor intake, output, and body weight to evaluate
     adequacy of fluid and caloric intake.
   • Provide positive feedback for client’s efforts.
   • Provide oral hygiene following each feeding.
   • Consider tube feedings/parenteral solutions as indicated for
     the client unable to achieve adequate nutritional intake.
   • Consult with dysphagia specialist/rehabilitation team as indi-
     cated.

     liquids/capsules are available.
   • Assist client and/or SO in learning specific feeding techniques
     and swallowing exercises.
   • Instruct client and/or SO in emergency measures in event of
     choking.
   • Encourage continuation of facial exercise program to main-

• Review laboratory studies (e.g., clotting times, Hb/Hct).
• Observe for signs of shock/sepsis. Note presence of bleeding
  or signs of DIC.
NURSING PRIORITY NO.     3. To maximize tissue perfusion:
RENAL
• Monitor vital signs.
• Measure urine output on a regular schedule. (Intake may be
  calculated against output.) Weigh daily.
• Administer medication (e.g., anticoagulants in presence of
  thrombosis, steroids in membranous nephropathy).
• Provide for diet restrictions, as indicated, while providing
  adequate calories to meet the body’s needs. (Restriction of
  protein helps limit BUN.)
• Provide psychologic support for client/SO(s), especially when
  progression of disease and resultant treatment (dialysis) may
  be long term.
CEREBRAL
• Elevate HOB (e.g., 10 degrees) and maintain head/neck in
  midline or neutral position to promote circulation/venous
  drainage.
• Administer medications (e.g., steroids/diuretics may be used
  to decrease edema, anticoagulants).
• Assist with/monitor hypothermia therapy, which may be used
  to decrease metabolic and O2 needs.
• Prepare client for surgery as indicated (e.g., carotid
  endarterectomy, evacuation of hematoma/space-occupying
  lesion).
• Refer to ND Intracranial Adaptive Capacity, decreased.
CARDIOPULMONARY
• Monitor vital signs, hemodynamics, heart sounds, and cardiac
  rhythm.
• Encourage quiet, restful atmosphere. Conserves energy/
  lowers tissue O2 demands.
• Caution client to avoid activities that increase cardiac work-
  load (e.g., straining at stool). Review ways of avoiding consti-
  pation.
• Administer medications (e.g., antidysrhythmics, fibrinolytic
  agents).
• Note signs of ischemia secondary to drug effects.
• Refer to ND Cardiac Output, decreased.

   GASTROINTESTINAL
   • Maintain gastric/intestinal decompression and measure
     output periodically.
   • Provide small/easily digested food and fluids when tolerated.
   • Encourage rest after meals to maximize blood flow to stom-
     ach enhancing digestion.
   • Prepare client for surgery as indicated. (May be a surgical
     emergency, e.g., resection, bypass graft, mesenteric endar-
     terectomy.)
   • Refer to ND Nutrition: imbalanced, less than body require-
     ments.
   PERIPHERAL
   • Perform assistive/active range-of-motion exercises (Buerger
     and Buerger-Allen).
   • Encourage early ambulation when possible. Enhances venous
     return.
   • Discourage sitting/standing for long periods, wearing
     constrictive clothing, crossing legs.
   • Elevate the legs when sitting, but avoid sharp angulation of
     the hips or knees.
   • Avoid use of knee gatch on bed; elevate entire foot as indi-
     cated.
   • Provide air mattress, sheepskin padding, bed/foot cradle to
     protect the extremities.
   • Elevate HOB at night to increase gravitational blood flow.
   • Apply antithromboembolic hose/Ace bandages to lower
     extremities before arising from bed to prevent venous stasis.
   • Use paper tape instead of adhesive.
   • Avoid massaging the leg when at risk for embolus.
   • Exercise caution in use of hot water bottles or heating pads;
     tissues may have decreased sensitivity due to ischemia. (Heat
     also increases the metabolic demands of already compro-
     mised tissues.)
   • Monitor circulation above/below casts. Apply ice and elevate
     limb as appropriate to reduce edema.
   • Encourage client to limit/quit smoking.
   • Assist with/prepare for medical procedures (e.g., sympathec-
     tomy, vein graft) to improve peripheral circulation.
   • Monitor closely for signs of shock when sympathectomy is
     done (result of unmediated vasodilation).
   • Administer medications with caution (e.g., vasodilators,
     papaverine, antilipemics, anticoagulants). Drug response,
     half-life, toxic levels may be altered by decreased tissue
     perfusion.
   • Monitor for signs of bleeding during use of fibrinolytic
     agents.

   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 1. To assess the extent of altered percep-
   tion and the related degree of disability:
   • Measure visual acuity and field of vision.
   • Assess sensory awareness (e.g., response to stimulus of hot/
     cold, dull/sharp); note problems with awareness of motion
     and proprioception.
   • Observe client’s behavior to determine the extent of impair-
     ment.
   • Assess ability to distinguish between right and left.
   • Note physical signs of neglect (e.g., disregard for position of
     affected limb(s), skin irritation/injury).
   • Observe ability to function within limits of impairment.
     Compare with client’s perception of own abilities.
   • Explore and encourage verbalization of feelings to identify
     meaning of loss/dysfunction/change to the client and impact
     it may have on assuming ADLs.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To promote optimal comfort and
   safety for the client in the environment:
   • Approach client from the unaffected side during acute phase.
     Explain to client that one side is being neglected; repeat as
     needed.
   • Orient to physical environment.
   • Remove excess stimuli from the environment when working
     with the client.
   • Encourage client to turn head and eyes in full rotation
     and “scan” the environment to compensate for visual field
     loss.
   • Position bedside table and objects (such as call bell, tissues)
     within functional field of vision.
   • Position furniture and equipment so travel path is not
     obstructed. Keep doors wide open or completely closed.

Discharge Considerations):
• Increase the amount of touch in providing client care.
• Encourage the client to look at and handle affected side to
  stimulate awareness.
• Bring the affected limb across the midline for the client to
  visualize during care.
• Provide tactile stimuli to the affected side by touching/
  manipulating, stroking, and communicating about the
  affected side by itself rather than stimulating both sides
  simultaneously.
• Provide objects of various weight, texture, and size for the
  client to handle.
• Assist the client to position the affected extremity care-
  fully and teach to routinely visualize placement of the
  extremity. Remind with visual cues. If the client completely
  ignores one side of the body, use positioning to improve
  perception (e.g., position client facing/looking at the affected
  side).
• Encourage client to accept affected limb/side as part of self
  even when it no longer feels like it belongs.
• Use a mirror to help the client adjust position by visualizing
  both sides of the body.
• Use descriptive terms to identify body parts rather than “left”
  and “right”; for example, “Lift this leg” (point to leg) or “Lift
  your affected leg.”
• Describe where affected areas of body are when moving the
  client.
• Acknowledge and accept feelings of despondency, grief, and
  anger. (When feelings are openly expressed, client can deal
  with them and move forward.)
• Reinforce to client the reality of the dysfunction and need to
  compensate.
• Avoid participating in the client’s use of denial.
• Encourage family members and SO(s) to treat client normally
  and not as an invalid, including client in family activities.
• Assist with ADLs, maximizing self-care potential. Help client
  to bathe, apply lotion, and so forth to affected side.
• Place nonessential items (e.g., TV, pictures, hairbrush) on
  affected side during postacute phase once client begins to
  cross midline to encourage continuation of behavior.
• Refer to/encourage client to use rehabilitative services to
  enhance independence in functioning.
• Identify additional resources to meet individual needs
  (e.g., Meals on Wheels, home-care services) to maximize
  independence, allow client to return to community set-
  ting.

OBJECTIVE
Incontinence
Retention
Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
Criteria—Client Will:
• Verbalize understanding of condition.
• Identify causative factors. (Refer to specific NDs for inconti-
  nence/retention as appropriate.)
• Achieve normal elimination pattern or participate in meas-
  ures to correct/compensate for defects.
• Demonstrate behaviors/techniques to prevent urinary in-
  fection.
• Manage care of urinary catheter, or stoma and appliance
  following urinary diversion.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO.         1. To assess causative/contributing
factors:
• Identify physical diagnoses that may be involved, such as
  surgery (including urinary diversion); neurologic deficits,
  such as MS, paraplegia/tetraplegia; mental/emotional dys-
  function; prostate disease; recent/multiple pregnancies;
  cardiovascular disease; pelvic trauma; use of penile clamps
  (may result in urethral trauma).
• Determine whether problem is due to loss of neurologic func-
  tioning or disorientation (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease).
• Determine pathology of bladder dysfunction relative to
  medical diagnosis identified. (For example, in neurologic/
  demyelinating diseases, such as MS, problem may be failure
  to store urine, empty bladder, or both.)
• Inspect stoma of urinary diversion for edema, scarring, pres-
  ence of congealed mucus.
• Review drug regimen. Note use of drugs that may be nephro-
  toxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines), especially in
  clients who are immunosuppressed. Also note those that may
  result in retention (e.g., atropine, belladonna).
• Note age and sex of client. (UTIs are more prevalent in
  women and older men.)
• Rule out gonorrhea in men when urethritis with a pe-
  nile discharge is present and there are no bacteria in the
  urine.
• Assist with antibody-coated bacteria assay to diagnose bacte-
  rial infection of the kidney or prostate.
• Review laboratory tests for hyperparathyroidism, changes in
  renal function, presence of infection.

   • Strain all urine for calculi and describe stones expelled and/or
     send to laboratory for analysis.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assess degree of interference/
   disability:
   • Determine client’s previous pattern of elimination and
     compare with current situation. Note reports of frequency,
     urgency, burning, incontinence, nocturia/enuresis, size and
     force of urinary stream.
   • Palpate bladder to assess retention.
   • Investigate pain, noting location, duration, intensity; presence
     of bladder spasms, back or flank pain, and so forth.
   • Determine client’s usual daily fluid intake (both amount and
     beverage choices/use of caffeine). Note condition of skin and
     mucous membranes, color of urine to help determine level of
     hydration.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.            3. To assist in treating/preventing
   urinary alteration:
   • Refer to specific NDs Incontinence (specify), Urinary
     Retention.
   • Encourage fluid intake up to 3000 to 4000 mL/day (within
     cardiac tolerance), including cranberry juice, to help main-
     tain renal function, prevent infection and formation of
     urinary stones, avoid encrustation around catheter, or to
     flush urinary diversion appliance.
   • Assist with developing toileting routines as appropriate.
   • Encourage client to void in sitz bath after surgical procedures
     of the perineal area. (Warm water helps relax muscles and
     soothe sore tissues, facilitating voiding.)
   • Observe for signs of infection—cloudy, foul odor; bloody
     urine. Send urine (midstream clean-voided specimen) for
     culture and sensitivities as indicated.
   • Encourage client to verbalize fear/concerns (e.g., disrup-
     tion in sexual activity, inability to work). Open expres-
     sion allows client to deal with feelings and begin problem
     solving.
   • Monitor medication regimen, antimicrobials (single-dose is
     frequently being used for UTI), sulfonamides, antispasmod-
     ics, and so on to note client’s response, need to modify treat-
     ment.
   • Discuss surgical procedures and review medical regimen for
     client with benign prostatic hypertrophy bladder/prostatic
     cancer, and so forth.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.         4. To assist in management of long-
   term urinary alterations:
   • Keep bladder deflated by use of an indwelling catheter
56 N U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E


    connected to closed drainage. Investigate alternatives when
                                                                        Urinary Elimination, impaired
    possible (e.g., intermittent catheterization, surgical interven-
    tions, urinary drugs, voiding maneuvers, condom catheter).
•   Provide latex-free catheter and care supplies to reduce risk of
    latex sensitivity.
•   Check frequently for bladder distention and observe for over-
    flow to reduce risk of infection and/or autonomic hyper-
    reflexia.
•   Maintain acidic environment of the bladder by the use of
    agents, such as vitamin C, Mandelamine when appropriate to
    discourage bacterial growth.
•   Adhere to a regular bladder/diversion appliance emptying
    schedule to avoid accidents.
•   Provide for routine diversion appliance care, and assist client
    to recognize and deal with problems such as alkaline salt
    encrustation, ill-fitting appliance, malodorous urine, infec-
    tion, and so forth.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 5. To promote wellness (Teaching/
Discharge Considerations):
• Emphasize importance of keeping area clean and dry to
  reduce risk of infection and/or skin breakdown.
• Instruct female clients with UTI to drink large amounts
  of fluid, void immediately after intercourse, wipe from
  front to back, promptly treat vaginal infections, and take
  showers rather than tub baths to limit risk/avoid reinfec-
  tion.
• Encourage SO(s) who participate in routine care to recognize
  complications (including latex allergy) necessitating medical
  interventions.
• Instruct in proper application and care of appliance for
  urinary diversion. Encourage liberal fluid intake, avoid-
  ance of foods/medications that produce strong odor, use of
  white vinegar or deodorizer in pouch to promote odor
  control.
• Identify sources for supplies, programs/agencies providing
  financial assistance to obtain needed equipment.
• Recommend avoidance of gas-forming foods in presence of
  ureterosigmoidostomy as flatus can cause urinary inconti-
  nence.
• Recommend use of silicone catheter when permanent/long-
  term catheterization is required.
• Demonstrate proper positioning of catheter drainage tubing
  and bag to facilitate drainage/prevent reflux.
• Refer client/SO(s) to appropriate community resources such
  as ostomy specialist, support group, sex therapist, psychiatric
  clinical nurse specialist, and so on to deal with changes in
  body image/function when indicated.

Urine is straw colored with no odor
Specific gravity is within normal limits
Amount of output is within normal limits for age and other factors
Fluid intake is adequate for daily needs
Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
Criteria—Client Will:
• Verbalize understanding of condition that has potential for
  altering elimination.
• Achieve normal elimination pattern, voiding in appropriate
  amounts.
• Alter environment to accommodate individual needs.
Actions/Interventions
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 1. To assess status and adaptive skills
being used by client:
• Identify physical diagnoses (e.g., surgery, childbirth, recent/
  multiple pregnancies, pelvic trauma, stroke, mental/emo-
  tional dysfunction, prostate disease) that may have impacted
  client’s elimination patterns.
• Determine client’s previous pattern of elimination and
  compare with current situation. Review voiding diary if avail-
  able. Provides baseline for future comparison.
• Observe voiding patterns, time, color, and amount voided if
  indicated (e.g., postsurgical or postpartum client) to docu-
  ment normalization of elimination.
• Ascertain methods of self-management (e.g., limiting or
  increasing liquid intake, regular voiding schedule).
• Determine client’s usual daily fluid intake. Both amount and
  beverage choices are important in managing elimination.
• Note condition of skin and mucous membranes, color of
  urine to help determine level of hydration.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assist client to improve manage-
ment of urinary elimination:
• Encourage fluid intake, including water and cranberry juice,
  to help maintain renal function, prevent infection.
• Regulate liquid intake at prescheduled times to promote
  predictable voiding pattern. Restrict fluid intake 2 to 3 hours
  before bedtime to reduce voiding during the night.
• Assist with modifying current routines as appropriate. Client
  may benefit from additional information in enhancing
  success, such as regarding cues/urge to void; adjusting sched-
  ule of voiding (shorter or longer); relaxation and/or distrac-
  tion techniques, standing or sitting upright during voiding to
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                       559


     ensure that bladder is completely empty, and/or practicing
     pelvic muscle strengthening exercises.
   • Provide assistance/devices as indicated (e.g., provide means
     of summoning assistance; place bedside commode, urinal, or
     bedpan within client’s reach; elevated toilet seats; mobility
     devices) when client is frail or mobility impaired.
   • Modify/recommend diet changes if indicated. For example,
     reduction of caffeine, because of its bladder irritant effect;
     or weight reduction may help reduce overactive bladder
     symptoms and incontinence with decreased pressure on the
     bladder.
   • Modify medication regimens as appropriate (e.g., administer
     prescribed diuretics in the morning to lessen nighttime void-
     ing). Reduce or eliminate use of hypnotics if possible as client
     may be too sedated to recognize/respond to urge to void.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        3. To promote optimum wellness:
   • Encourage continuation of successful toileting program
     and identify possible alterations to meet individual needs
     (e.g., use of adult briefs for extended outing or travel with
     limited access to toilet). Promotes proactive problem solving
     and supports normalization of activities.
   • Instruct client/SO(s)/caregivers in cues that client needs, such
     as voiding on routine schedule, showing client location of the
     bathroom, providing adequate room lighting, signs, color
     coding of door, to assist client in continued continence espe-
     cially when in unfamiliar surroundings.
   • Review signs/symptoms of urinary complications and need
     for medical follow-up. Promotes timely intervention to limit
     or prevent adverse events.

   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.            1. To assess causative/contributing
   factors:
   • Determine if client is voluntarily postponing urination.
   • Review history for disease, use of medication/substances
     known to increase urine output and/or alter bladder tone
     (e.g., diabetes mellitus, prolapsed bladder, diuretics, alcohol,
     caffeine).
   • Test urine with Chemstix to note presence of glucose, which
     can cause polyuria and result in overdistention of the
     bladder.
   • Determine the difference between the time it takes to get to
     the bathroom/remove clothing and the time between urge
     and involuntary loss of urine.
   • Review disease process and medications. Could affect mental
     status/orientation to place, recognition of urge to void, and/
     or its significance.
   • Identify environmental conditions that interfere with timely
     access to bathroom/successful toileting process. Factors such
     as unfamiliar surroundings, dexterity problems, poor light-
     ing, improperly fitted chair walker, low toilet seat, absence of
     safety bars, and travel distance to toilet may affect self-care
     ability.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assess degree of interference/
   disability:
   • Assist client to keep voiding diary. Determine the frequency
     and timing of continent/incontinent voids.
   • Measure/estimate amount of urine voided or lost with incon-
     tinence.
   • Examine urine for signs of bacteriuria (e.g., cloudy/hazy).
   • Ascertain effect on lifestyle (including socialization and sexu-
     ality) and self-esteem.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.            3. To assist in treating/preventing
   incontinence:
   • Administer prescribed diuretics in the morning to lessen
     nighttime voidings.
   • Reduce or eliminate use of hypnotics if possible, as client may
     be too sedated to recognize/respond to urge to void.
   • Provide means of summoning assistance (e.g., call light or
     bell).
   • Adapt clothes for quick removal: Velcro fasteners, full skirts,
     crotchless panties or no panties, suspenders or elastic waists
     instead of belts on pants. Facilitates toileting once urge to
     void is noted.
   • Use night-lights to mark bathroom location.

     condition as indicated (surgery, medications, biofeedback,
     etc.).
   • Suggest starting and stopping stream 2 or 3 times during
     voiding to isolate muscles involved in voiding process for
     exercise training.
   • Encourage regular pelvic floor strengthening exercises (Kegel
     exercises or use of vaginal cones). Combine activity with
     biofeedback as appropriate to enhance training.
   • Incorporate “bent-knee sit-ups” into exercise program to
     increase abdominal muscle tone.
   • Suggest that client urinate at least every 3 hours during the
     day to reduce bladder pressure. Recommend consciously
     delaying voiding as appropriate to slowly achieve desired 3- to
     4-hour intervals between voids.

   Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
   Criteria—Client Will:
   • Reestablish/maintain effective respiratory pattern via ven-
     tilator with absence of retractions/use of accessory muscles,
     cyanosis, or other signs of hypoxia; and with ABGs/Sao2
     within acceptable range.
   • Participate in efforts to wean (as appropriate) within individ-
     ual ability.
   Caregiver Will:
   • Demonstrate behaviors necessary to maintain respiratory
     function.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        1. To determine degree of impairment:
   • Investigate etiology of respiratory failure to determine client’s
     future capabilities, ventilation needs, and most appropriate
     type of ventilatory support.
   • Assess spontaneous respiratory pattern, noting rate, depth,
     rhythm, symmetry of chest movement, use of accessory mus-
     cles to measure work of breathing.
   • Auscultate breath sounds, noting presence/absence and equal-
     ity of breath sounds, adventitious breath sounds.
   • Obtain ABGs, pulmonary function studies as appropriate.
82 N U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E


• Review chest x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/
                                                                      Ventilation, impaired spontaneous
  CT scan results if done.
• Note response to respiratory therapy (e.g., bronchodilators,
  supplemental oxygen, IPPB treatments).
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To provide/maintain ventilatory
support:
• Observe overall breathing pattern, distinguishing between
  spontaneous respirations and ventilator breaths.
• Administer sedation as required to synchronize respirations
  and reduce work of breathing/energy expenditure.
• Count client’s respirations for 1 full minute and compare to
  desired/ventilator set rate.
• Verify that client’s respirations are in phase with the ventila-
  tor. Decreases work of breathing, maximizes O2 delivery.
• Inflate tracheal/endotracheal tube cuff properly using mini-
  mal leak/occlusive technique. Check cuff inflation every 4 to 8
  hours and whenever cuff is deflated/reinflated to prevent risk
  associated with under/overinflation.
• Check tubing for obstruction (e.g., kinking or accumulation
  of water). Drain tubing as indicated; avoid draining toward
  the client, or back into the reservoir resulting in contamina-
  tion/providing medium for growth of bacteria.
• Check ventilator alarms for proper functioning. Do not turn
  off alarms, even for suctioning. Remove from ventilator and
  ventilate manually if source of ventilator alarm cannot be
  quickly identified and rectified. Verify that alarms can be
  heard in the nurses’ station by care providers.
• Assess ventilator settings routinely and readjust as indicated
  according to client’s primary disease and results of diagnostic
  testing.
• Verify that oxygen line is in proper outlet/tank; monitor inline
  oxygen analyzer or perform periodic oxygen analysis.
• Note tidal volume (10 to 15 mL/kg). Verify proper function of
  spirometer, bellows, or computer readout of delivered
  volume. Note alterations from desired volume delivery to
  determine alteration in lung compliance or leakage through
  machine/around tube cuff (if used).
• Monitor airway pressure for developing complications/
  equipment problems.
• Monitor inspiratory and expiratory (I:E) ratio.
• Promote maximal ventilation of alveoli; check sigh rate inter-
  vals (usually 11/2 to 2 times tidal volume). Reduces risk of
  atelectasis, helps mobilize secretions.
• Note inspired humidity and temperature; maintain hydration
  to liquefy secretions facilitating removal.
• Auscultate breath sounds periodically. Note frequent crackles
  or rhonchi that do not clear with coughing/suctioning
       NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                       583


     because they may indicate developing complications (atelec-
     tasis, pneumonia, acute bronchospasm, pulmonary edema).
   • Suction as needed to clear secretions.
   • Note changes in chest symmetry. May indicate improper
     placement of ET tube, development of barotrauma.
   • Keep resuscitation bag at bedside and ventilate manually
     whenever indicated (e.g., if client is removed from ventilator
     or troubleshooting equipment problems).
   • Administer and monitor response to medications that
     promote airway patency and gas exchange.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To prepare for/assist with weaning
   process if appropriate:
   • Determine physical/psychological readiness to wean, includ-
     ing specific respiratory parameters; presence/absence of infec-
     tion, cardiac failure, nutritional status.
   • Explain weaning activities/techniques, individual plan and
     expectations. Reduces fear of unknown.
   • Elevate head of bed/place in orthopedic chair if possible, or
     position to alleviate dyspnea and to facilitate oxygenation.
   • Assist client in “taking control” of breathing if weaning is
     attempted or ventilatory support is interrupted during proce-
     dure/activity.
   • Coach client to take slower, deeper breaths, practice abdomi-
     nal/pursed-lip breathing, assume position of comfort, and use
     relaxation techniques to maximize respiratory function.
   • Assist client to practice effective coughing, secretion manage-
     ment.
   • Provide quiet environment, calm approach, undivided atten-
     tion of nurse. Promotes relaxation decreasing energy/oxygen
     requirements.
   • Involve family/SO(s) as appropriate. Provide diversional
     activity. Helps client focus on something other than
     breathing.
   • Instruct client in use of energy-saving techniques during care
     activities to limit oxygen consumption/fatigue.
   • Acknowledge and provide ongoing encouragement for client’s
     efforts. Communicate hope for successful weaning response
     (even partial). Enhances commitment to continue activity,
     maximizing outcomes.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        4. To prepare for discharge on ventila-
   tor when indicated:
   • Ascertain plan for discharge placement (e.g., return home,
     short-term/permanent placement in long-term care—LTC).
   • Determine specific equipment needs. Identify resources for
     equipment needs/maintenance and arrange for delivery prior
     to client discharge.

• Review layout of home, noting size of rooms, doorways;
                                                                     Ventilation, impaired spontaneous
  placement of furniture, number/type of electrical outlets to
  identify necessary changes.
• Obtain no-smoking signs to be posted in home. Encourage
  family members to refrain from smoking.
• Have family/SO(s) notify utilities company and fire depart-
  ment of presence of ventilator in home.
• Review and provide written materials regarding proper venti-
  lator management, maintenance, and safety for reference in
  home setting, enhancing client’s/SO’s level of comfort.
• Demonstrate airway management techniques and proper
  equipment cleaning practices.
• Instruct SO(s)/care provider in other pulmonary physiother-
  apy measures as indicated (e.g., chest physiotherapy—CPT).
• Allow sufficient opportunity for SO(s)/family to practice new
  skills. Role-play potential crisis situations to enhance confi-
  dence in ability to handle client’s needs.
• Identify signs/symptoms requiring prompt medical evalua-
  tion/intervention. Timely treatment may prevent progres-
  sion of problem.
• Provide positive feedback and encouragement for efforts
  of SO(s)/family. Promotes continuation of desired be-
  haviors.
• List names and phone numbers for identified contact
  persons/resources. Refer to individual(s) who have managed
  home ventilation. Round-the-clock availability reduces sense
  of isolation and enhances likelihood of obtaining appropri-
  ate information when needed.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 5. To promote wellness (Teaching/
Discharge Considerations):
• Discuss impact of specific activities on respiratory status and
  problem-solve solutions to maximize weaning effort.
• Engage client in specialized exercise program to enhance
  respiratory muscle strength and general endurance.
• Protect client from sources of infection (e.g., monitor health
  of visitors, roommate, staff involved in care).
• Recommend involvement in support group; introduce to
  individuals dealing with similar problems to provide role
  models, assistance for problem solving.
• Encourage time-out for care providers so they may attend to
  personal needs, wellness, and growth.
• Provide opportunities for client/SO(s) to discuss termination
  of therapy/end-of-life decisions.
• Identify ventilator-dependent individuals who are success-
  fully managing condition to encourage hope for the future.
• Refer to additional resources (e.g., spiritual advisor, coun-
  selor).

   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.           1. To identify contributing factors/
   degree of dysfunction:
   • Note length of ventilator dependence. Review previous
     episodes of dependence/weaning.
   • Assess physical factors involved in weaning (e.g., stability of
     vital signs, hydration status, presence of fever/pain; nutri-
     tional intake and muscle strength).
   • Ascertain client’s understanding of weaning process, expecta-
     tions, and concerns.
   • Determine psychologic readiness, presence/degree of anxiety.
   • Review laboratory studies reflecting number/integrity of red
     blood cells (O2 transport) and nutritional status (sufficient
     energy to meet demands of weaning).
   • Review chest x-ray/pulse oximetry and ABGs.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.        2. To support weaning process:
   • Consult with dietitian, nutritional support team for adjust-
     ments of composition of diet to prevent excessive production
     of CO2, which could alter respiratory drive.
   • Explain weaning techniques, e.g., T-piece, SIMV, CPAP, pres-
     sure support. Discuss individual plan and expectations.
     Reduces fear of unknown, enhances sense of trust.
   • Introduce client to individual who has shared similar experi-
     ences with successful outcome.

  dures/situations or nonessential activities.
• Time medications during weaning efforts to minimize seda-
  tive effects.
• Provide quiet room; calm approach, undivided attention of
  nurse. Enhances relaxation, conserving energy.
• Involve SO(s)/family as appropriate (e.g., sit at bedside,
  provide encouragement, and help monitor client status).
• Provide diversional activity (e.g., watching TV, reading aloud)
  to focus attention away from breathing.
• Note response to activity/client care during weaning and limit
  as indicated to prevent excessive O2 consumption/demand
  with increased possibility of failure.
• Auscultate breath sounds periodically; suction airway as indi-
  cated.
• Acknowledge and provide ongoing encouragement for client’s
  efforts.
• Minimize setbacks, focus client attention on gains and
  progress to date to reduce frustration that may further
  impair progress.
• Suspend weaning (take a “holiday”) periodically as individu-
  ally appropriate (e.g., initially may “rest” 45 or 50 minutes
  each hour, progressing to a 20-minute rest every 4 hours, then
  weaning during daytime and resting during night).

    (e.g., irritability, lack of cooperation, demanding behavior,
                                                                         Violence, [actual/] risk for self-directed
    body posture/expression).
•   Identify conditions such as acute/chronic brain syndrome;
    panic state; hormonal imbalance (e.g., PMS, postpartal
    psychosis, drug-induced, postsurgical/postseizure confusion;
    psychomotor seizure activity) that may interfere with ability
    to control own behavior.
•   Review laboratory findings (e.g., blood alcohol, blood
    glucose, ABGs, electrolytes, renal function tests).
•   Observe for signs of suicidal/homicidal intent (e.g., perceived
    morbid or anxious feeling while with the client; warning from
    the client, “It doesn’t matter,” “I’d/They’d be better off dead”;
    mood swings; “accident-prone”/self-destructive behavior;
    suicidal attempts, possession of alcohol and/or other drug(s)
    in known substance abuser).
•   Note family history of suicidal/homicidal behavior.
•   Ask directly if the person is thinking of acting on thoughts/
    feelings to determine violent intent.
•   Determine availability of suicidal/homicidal means.
•   Assess client coping behaviors already present. (Note: Client
    believes there are no alternatives other than violence.)
•   Identify risk factors and assess for indicators of child abuse/
    neglect: unexplained/frequent injuries, failure to thrive, and
    so forth.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assist client to accept responsibil-
ity for impulsive behavior and potential for violence:
• Develop therapeutic nurse-client relationship. Provide consis-
   tent caregiver when possible. Promotes sense of trust, allow-
   ing client to discuss feelings openly.
• Maintain straightforward communication to avoid reinforc-
   ing manipulative behavior.
• Note motivation for change (e.g., failing relationships, job
   loss, involvement with judicial system). Crisis situation can
   provide impetus for change but requires timely therapeutic
   intervention to sustain efforts.
• Help client recognize that own actions may be in response to
   own fear (may be afraid of own behavior, loss of control),
   dependency, and feeling of powerlessness.
• Make time to listen to expressions of feelings. Acknowledge
   reality of client’s feelings and that feelings are OK. (Refer to
   ND Self-Esteem, [specify].)
• Confront client’s tendency to minimize situation/behavior.
• Identify factors (feelings/events) involved in precipitating
   violent behavior.
• Discuss impact of behavior on others/consequences of
   actions.
        NURSING DIAGNOSES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER                         593


   • Acknowledge reality of suicide/homicide as an option. Dis-
     cuss consequences of actions if they were to follow through
     on intent. Ask how it will help client to resolve problems.
   • Accept client’s anger without reacting on emotional basis.
     Give permission to express angry feelings in acceptable ways
     and let client know that staff will be available to assist in main-
     taining control. Promotes acceptance and sense of safety.
   • Help client identify more appropriate solutions/behaviors
     (e.g., motor activities/exercise) to lessen sense of anxiety and
     associated physical manifestations.
   • Provide directions for actions client can take, avoiding nega-
     tives, such as “do nots.”
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To assist client in controlling be-
   havior:
   • Contract with client regarding safety of self/others.
   • Give client as much control as possible within constraints of
     individual situation. Enhances self-esteem, promotes confi-
     dence in ability to change behavior.
   • Be truthful when giving information and dealing with client.
     Builds trust, enhancing therapeutic relationship.
   • Identify current/past successes and strengths. Discuss effec-
     tiveness of coping techniques used and possible changes.
     (Refer to ND Coping, ineffective.) Client is often not aware of
     positive aspects of life, and once recognized, they can be used
     as a basis for change.
   • Assist client to distinguish between reality and hallucina-
     tions/delusions.
   • Approach in positive manner, acting as if the client has
     control and is responsible for own behavior. Be aware,
     though, that the client may not have control, especially if
     under the influence of drugs (including alcohol).
   • Maintain distance and do not touch client when situation
     indicates client does not tolerate such closeness (e.g., post-
     trauma response).

     drug regimen (e.g., anticonvulsants/antidepressants).
   • Give positive reinforcement for client’s efforts. Encourages
     continuation of desired behaviors.
   • Explore death fantasies when expressed (e.g., “I’ll look down
     and watch them suffer; they’ll be sorry,”“They’ll be glad to get
     rid of me”) or the idea that death is not final (e.g., “I can come
     back”).

   Desired Outcomes/Evaluation
   Criteria—Client Will:
   • Be free of injury, or unplanned exits.
   Caregiver(s) Will:
   • Modify environment as indicated to enhance safety.
   • Provide for maximal independence of client.
   Actions/Interventions
   NURSING PRIORITY NO.          1. To assess degree of impairment/stage
   of disease process:
   • Ascertain history of client’s memory loss and cognitive
      changes.
   • Note results of diagnostic testing, confirming diagnosis and
      type of dementia.
   • Evaluate client’s mental status during daytime and nighttime,
      noting when client’s confusion is most pronounced, and
      when client sleeps.
   • Monitor client’s use/need for assistive devices such as glasses,
      hearing aids, cane, and so forth.
   • Assess frequency and pattern of wandering behavior to deter-
      mine individual risks/safety needs.
   • Identify client’s reason for wandering if possible (e.g., looking
      for lost item, desire to go home, boredom, need for activity,
      hunger, thirst, or discomfort).
   • Ascertain if client has delusions due to shadows, lights, and
      noises.
   NURSING PRIORITY NO. 2. To assist client/caregiver to deal with
   situations:
   • Provide a structured daily routine. Decreases wandering
      behavior and minimizes caregiver stress.
   • Encourage participation in family activities and familiar
      routines such as folding laundry, listening to music, walking
      outdoors. Activities and exercises may reduce anxiety and
      restlessness.
   • Bring client to bathroom on a regular schedule.
   • Provide safe place for client to wander, away from safety
      hazards (e.g., hot water/kitchen stove, open stairway) and
      other noisy clients. Arrange furniture and other items to
      accommodate wandering.
   • Make sure that doors have alarms and that alarms are turned

                                                                          Wandering [specify sporadic or continuous]
    to prevent unsafe exits.
•   Provide 24-hour reality orientation. (Client can be awake at
    any time and fail to recognize day/night routines.)
•   Sit with client and talk. Provide TV/radio/music.
•   Avoid overstimulation from activities or new partners/room-
    mate during rest periods when client is in a facility.
•   Use pressure-sensitive bed/chair alarms to alert caregivers of
    movement.
•   Avoid using physical or chemical restraints (sedatives) to
    control wandering behavior. May increase agitation, sensory
    deprivation, and falls, and may contribute to wandering
    behavior.
•   Provide consistent staff as much as possible.
•   Provide room near monitoring station; check client location
    on frequent basis.
NURSING PRIORITY NO. 3. To Promote Wellness (Teaching/
Discharge Considerations):
• Identify problems that are remediable and assist client/SO to
  seek appropriate assistance and access resources. (Encourages
  problem solving to improve condition rather than accept the
  status quo.)
• Notify neighbors about client’s condition and request
  that they contact client’s family or local police if they see client
  outside alone. Community awareness can prevent/reduce
  risk of client being lost or hurt.
• Use community resources, such as Alzheimer’s Association
  Safe Return Program, to assist in identification, location, and
  safe return of individual with wandering behaviors.
• Help client/SO develop plan of care when problem is pro-
  gressive.
• Refer to community resources such as day care programs,
  support groups, and so forth.
• Refer to NDs: Confusion, acute; Sensory Perception,
  disturbed (specify: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, gustatory,
  tactile, olfactory); Injury, risk for; Falls, risk for.

                Client Concerns with
                     Associated Nursing
                                           Diagnoses
   This chapter presents over 400 disorders/health conditions
reflecting all specialty areas, with associated nursing diagnoses
written as client problem/need statements that include “related
to” and “evidenced by” statements.
   This section will facilitate and help validate the assessment
and diagnosis steps of the nursing process. Because the nursing
process is perpetual and ongoing, other nursing diagnoses may
be appropriate based on changing individual situations.
Therefore, the nurse must continually assess, identify, and vali-
date new client needs and evaluate subsequent care. Once the
appropriate nursing diagnoses have been selected from this
chapter, the reader may refer to Chapter 4, which lists the 167
NANDA diagnoses, and review the diagnostic definition, defin-
ing characteristics, and related or risk factors for further valida-
tion. This step is necessary to determine if the nursing diagnosis
statement is an accurate match, if more data are required, or if
another diagnosis needs to be investigated.
   To facilitate access to the health conditions/concerns and
nursing diagnoses, the client needs have been listed alphabeti-
cally and coded to identify nursing specialty areas.
MS: Medical-Surgical
PED: Pediatric
OB: Obstetric
CH: Community/Home
PSY: Psychiatric/Behavioral
GYN: Gynecological
   A separate category for geriatric has not been made because
geriatric concerns/conditions actually are subsumed under the
other specialty areas, because elderly persons are susceptible to
the majority of these problems.
