The primary nurse needs to periodically review the client’s progress and the effectiveness of the treatment plan. Persons then are able to read the notes and have a clear picture of what occurred with the client in order to make appropriate judgments regarding client management. The best way to ensure the clarity of progress notes is through the use of descriptive (or observational) statements. Observations of client behavior and response to therapy provide invaluable information. Through this communication, it can be determined if the client’s current desired outcomes or interventions need to be eliminated or altered and if the development of new outcomes or interventions is warranted.
