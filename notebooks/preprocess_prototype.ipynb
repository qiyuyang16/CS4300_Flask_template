In Chapter 3, the NDs have been categorized into divisions (Diagnostic Divisions: Nursing Diagnoses Organized According to a Nursing Focus, Section 2) and an assessment tool designed to assist the nurse to identify appropriate NDs as the data are collected. Nurses may feel at risk in committing themselves to documenting a nursing diagnosis for fear they might be wrong. However, unlike medical diagnoses, NDs can change as the client progresses through various stages of illness/maladaptation to resolution of the condition/situation.\n\n\n2,   cosine score: 1.0037902326754855,   page: 42\nUse of herbal supplements (specify): Admitting diagnosis per provider: Reason per client: History of current complaint: Client expectations of this hospitalization: Previous illnesses and/or hospitalizations/surgeries: Evidence of failure to improve: Last complete physical examination:\n\n\n3,   cosine score: 0.7751301081587798,   page: 30\nThe client assessment is the foundation on which identification of individual needs, responses, and problems is based. To facilitate the steps of assessment and diagnosis in the nursing process, an assessment tool (Assessment Tools for Choosing Nursing Diagnoses, Section 1) has been constructed using a nursing focus instead of the medical approach of “review of systems.” This has the advantage of identifying and validating nursing diagnoses (NDs) as opposed to medical diagnoses.\n\n\n4,   cosine score: 0.7472699919444568,   page: 30\nTo achieve this nursing focus, we have grouped the NANDA International (formerly the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) NDs into related categories titled Diagnostic Divisions (Section 2), which reflect a blending of theories, primarily Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and a self-care philosophy. These divisions serve as the framework or outline for data collection/clustering that focuses attention on the nurse’s phenomena of concern—the human responses to actual and potential health problems—and directs the nurse to the most likely corresponding NDs.\n\n\n5,   cosine score: 0.0,   page: 50\nN U R S E ’ S P O C K E T G U I D E\n\n\n6,   cosine score: 0.0,   page: 37\nFeeding:\n\n\n7,   cosine score: 0.0,   page: 37\nToileting:\n\n\n8,   cosine score: 0.0,   page: 37\nDressing/grooming:\n\n\n9,   cosine score: 0.0,   page: 37\nMobility: Hygiene:\n\n\n10,   cosine score: 0.0,   page: 37\nActivities of daily living: Independent/dependent (level):\n\n\n"
