Introduction\\nIndications\\nThe Curato™ Wound Treatment System is indicated for the application of suction (negative pressure) to\\nwounds to promote wound healing and for the removal of fluids, including wound exudates, irrigation\\nfluids, body fluids and infectious materials.\\nContraindications\\nThe Curato™ Wound Treatment System is contraindicated for patients with malignancy in the wound,\\nuntreated osteomyelIitis, non-enteric and unexplored fistulas, or necrotic tissue with eschar present. Do\\nnot place the foam dressing over exposed blood vessels or organs.\\nPrecautions\\nPrecautions should be taken for patients with active bleeding, difficult wound hemostasis, or who are on\\nanticoagulants. When placing the foam dressing in close proximity to blood vessels or organs, take\\ncare to ensure that they are adequately protected with overlying fascia, tissue or other protective\\nbarriers. Exposed tendon, nerves or blood vessels should be protected by moving available muscle or\\nfascia over them or by a layer of synthetic material. Greater care should be taken with respect to\\nweakened, irradiated or sutured blood vessels or organs. Bone fragments or sharp edges could puncture\\na dressing barrier, vessel or organ. Wounds with enteric fistula require special precautions in order to\\noptimize therapy.\\nAdditional Precautions\\n   Defibrillation: Remove the dressing if defibrillation is required in the area of dressing placement.\\n   Failure to remove the dressing may inhibit electrical current transmission and/or patient resuscitation.\\n   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): The Curato™ Suction Pump Unit is not MRI-compatible. Do not\\n   take into the MRI area.\\n   Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBO): NEVER allow a device—whether on or off—inside a\\n   hyperbaric chamber. The device must be disconnected from the patient prior to HBO treatment.\\n   Large Canisters: Use of Large Canisters (>500ml) may increase serious risks associated with excessive\\n   fluid loss. Monitor patient status continually. DO NOT USE for patients with low fluid volume, nor for patients\\n   at high risk of major hemorrhage.\\n   During Negative Pressure Therapy, the Curato™ Suction Pump and dressing are a closed system\\n   and are NOT vented to atmosphere.\\n   During Therapy, when a canister fills with fluid, it should be replaced immediately as fluids such as\\n   wound exudate will not be removed from the dressing once the canister is full.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                              2\\nSafety Tips\\nThe Curato™ Wound Treatment System is indicated for the application of suction (negative pressure) to\\nwounds to promote wound healing and for the removal of fluids, including wound exudates, irrigation\\nfluids, body fluids and infectious materials.\\nKEEP THERAPY ON\\nThe Curato™ Wound Treatment System should be operated at least 22 hours out of every 24 hour\\nperiod. Remove the foam dressing if therapy is terminated or is off for more than 2 hours in a 24 hour\\nperiod.\\nDRESSING CHANGES\\nClean the wound per veterinarian order prior to dressing application. Routine dressing changes should\\noccur every 48 to 72 hours. Dressing changes for infected wounds should be accomplished more\\nfrequently than 48 to 72 hours. Always replace with sterile disposables from unopened packages. Follow\\nestablished institution protocols regarding clean versus sterile technique.\\nMONITORING THE WOUND\\nInspect the dressing frequently to ensure that the foam is collapsed and that therapy is being delivered\\nin a consistent manner. Monitor periwound tissue and exudate for signs of infection or other\\ncomplications.* Extra care and attention should be given if there are any signs of possible infection or\\nrelated complications. Infection can be serious. With or without the Curato™ Wound Treatment System,\\ninfection can lead to many adverse complications including pain, discomfort, fever, septic shock, and\\nvarious other complications. With signs of more serious complications of infection, discontinue the use of the Curato™\\nWound Treatment System until the serious infection is diagnosed and properly treated.\\nDISCOMFORT / ADHERENCE\\nIf patient appears uncomfortable during dressing change, consider pre-medication, such as use of a\\nnon-adherent prior to foam placement or irrigation of a topical anesthetic agent such as 1% Lidocaine\\nprior to dressing removal.\\nUNSTABLE STRUCTURES\\nUse the lowest pressure setting on the Curato™ Wound Treatment System over unstable body\\nstructures such as unstable chest wall or non-intact fascia.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                              3\\nBODY CAVITY WOUNDS\\nUnderlying structures must be covered by natural tissues or synthetic materials that form a complete\\nbarrier between the underlying structures and the dressing.\\nINFINITI MEDICAL DRESSING USE\\nThe dressings are to be used exclusively with the Curato™ Wound Treatment System.\\nNOTE: All dressing components of the Curato™ Wound Treatment System are packaged sterile. The decision\\nto use clean versus sterile/aseptic technique is dependent upon wound pathophysiology and\\nclinician preference. All components of the Curato™ Wound Treatment System disposable set are\\nlatex free.\\nBe sure to comply with all other CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS for the Curato™ Wound\\nTreatment System.\\n*Signs of possible infection may include fever, tenderness, redness, swelling, increased warmth in the\\n                                                                                  \\t\\r \\xa0\\n wound area, purulent discharge or a strong odor. Vomiting, diarrhea, high fever, refractory hypotension,\\n may be added signs of more serious complications of infection.\\nWARNING: Do not pack the foam dressings into any areas of the wound. Forcing dressings in a\\ncompressed manner into any wound is contrary to approved protocols.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                                 4\\nFeatures\\nEasy-to-use “One-Touch” Operation - Therapy activation and change of pressure settings can be\\naccomplished with the push of a button.

Patient Care\\nIt is recommended that all sections of this manual be reviewed prior to using the product. Carefully read\\nthe INDICATIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS and SAFETY TIPS in the INTRODUCTION\\nsection before attempting to perform patient care for a patient with the Curato™ Wound Treatment\\nSystem.\\nApplying the Dressing\\n1. Cleanse the wound according to institutional protocols or veterinarians order.\\n2. Debride all necrotic tissue including eschar and hardened slough.\\n3. Be certain the wound has achieved hemostasis.\\n4. Visually examine and palpate wound bed to locate any blood vessels or delicate underlying structure\\nin close proximity.\\n5. Prepare area around wound to permit adhesion of the polyurethane drape.\\nNOTE: If peri-wound area is excessively moist or oily, a medical-grade liquid adhesive may improve sealing.\\nFor fragile skin, use a skin sealant prior to drape application, or frame the wound with a skin barrier layer. Cut\\nthe drape to a size large enough to cover the foam and the barrier layer only.\\n6. Take measurements of the wound dimensions and note wound type. Select the appropriate foam\\nbased on wound assessment. Cut the foam dressing to a size that is appropriate for the wound.\\nNOTE: Do not trim the foam dressing over or around the wound site to help prevent debris from the foam\\ndressing from falling into the wound.\\n7. Place the foam dressing in the wound site taking care to avoid contact with the peri-wound skin.\\nWARNING: Do not pack the foam dressings into any areas of the wound. Forcing dressings in a\\ncompressed manner into any wound is contrary to approved protocols. Loosely fill all visible and\\ninvisible dead space in the wound.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                                  8\\nNOTE: The foam dressing should cover the entire wound margin, including tunneling and undermining.\\nHowever, the foam dressing should not be in contact with intact skin.\\n8. Size and trim the polyurethane drape to cover dressing plus a 3-5 cm border of intact skin (extra\\npieces of drape can be used to seal dressing leaks). Remove the drape’s release liner and place over\\nthe foam dressing and peri-wound.\\n9. Pat drape material down around the wound site and over the foam dressing to ensure dressing is\\nproperly sealed.\\n10. Cut a 1 cm diameter hole in the top of the drape at a convenient location over the dressing (see\\n    Fig. 1).\\n11.

Verify the dressing application is correct, the tubing is connected, and the suction tubing with\\nSlickConnect™ clamp is open.\\n2. Place the therapy unit in an upright position as level with the wound as possible. The device can be\\nplaced on a table, or attached to an I.V. pole using the I.V. Pole adapter.\\nCAUTION: The I.V. pole clamp should only be used on poles that are in excess of 0.9” (2.2 cm)\\ndiameter and are securely attached to a bed frame or suitable stand. To ensure stability of the\\ntherapy unit on the I.V. pole, it should be clamped no higher than two times the width of the pole\\nbase. The clamp should be tightened to ensure that the therapy unit cannot slide down the pole.\\n3. Press the ON button. All LED indicators will sequentially illuminate during the power-on self-test.\\n4. Each time the device is turned on, the front panel LED display will indicate the remaining therapy life\\nof the unit using the following display format: “d XX, h YY”. For example, if the display (for a 30-day\\ndevice) indicates “d 11 h 22,” this means 11 days and 22 hours of therapy remain on the device. This\\ninformation can also be interpreted as the device has been used for 18 days and 2 hours.\\n5. Upon turning on the device, the dressing should slowly collapse indicating the presence of suction.\\nOnce dressing integrity is verified, adjust the unit for desired therapy. NOTE: The device must be\\nconnected to the A.C. Adapter while attempting to obtain an initial dressing seal.\\n6. Carefully check dressing for vacuum leaks, and repair with additional polyurethane drape, if\\nnecessary.\\n7. The Curato™ Wound Treatment System should be operated at least 22 hours out of every 24-hour\\nperiod. Remove the dressing if therapy is terminated or is off for more than 2 hours in a 24 hour\\nperiod.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                                14\\nTherapy Setting Adjustment\\nCAUTION: Only a veterinarian can prescribe the proper settings and protocols for the therapy unit.\\nFailure to follow product instructions or adjusting settings and performing therapy application\\nwithout the express direction and/or supervision of a veterinarian may lead to improper\\nproduct performance and the potential for serious or fatal injury.\\nNegative Pressure Level Adjustment\\nThere are five negative pressure settings that can be selected: -50 mmHg, -75 mmHg, -100 mmHg, -125\\nmmHg and -150 mmHg. The pressure selection buttons are located on the left side of the control panel.\\nThe         button decreases the negative pressure setting and the           button increases the negative\\npressure setting.\\n1. When the unit is powered-up, the current setting is selected automatically (unless therapy setting has\\nbeen locked previously by caregiver, see “Therapy Selection Lock/Unlock” Section).\\n2. To change the setting, simply press either the          therapy selection button or      therapy selection\\n    button until desired therapy selection is indicated by the green LED.\\n3. The green LED indicator will flash indicating the selection has been made and will continue flashing\\nuntil the desired negative pressure level has been achieved at which time the LED will remain\\nilluminated. If the green LED indicator begins to flash during therapy, it means the device is unable to\\nmaintain the therapeutic setting. This event would most likely be associated with a dressing leak and\\nwill require clinician intervention to correct.\\nIntermittent Mode ON/OFF\\nThe Curato™ can operate in an intermittent suction mode with a 5 minute “ON” and 2 minute “OFF”\\ncycle. Press the       button to turn the Intermittent Mode on and off.\\nDuring intermittent operation, Curato™ will provide target therapy pressure during the “ON” part of the\\ncycle and approximately -25 mmHg during the “off” part of the cycle. By maintaining this lower pressure\\nwhile the unit is “OFF,” the dressing seal is never compromised. This method of applying intermittent\\npressure also increases patient comfort.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                                  15\\nBeeper Volume Adjustment\\nThe volume of the beeper can be adjusted to fit various care settings or patient preferences. To adjust\\nthe beeper volume, press and hold the ON button while simultaneously pressing the                    button to\\nincrease the volume, or the        button to decrease the volume. The LED display will indicate the volume\\nlevel.\\nBattery Operation\\nNOTE: The Curato™ Wound Treatment System is designed to permit use of the product while the internal\\nbattery is charging. The therapy unit will continue to operate properly while the battery is charging.\\nBattery Life\\nThe specified battery life of the Curato™ Wound Treatment System with a fully-charged battery and a\\nwell-sealed dressing is up to 24 hours. The actual life is dependent on the integrity of the dressing. A leak\\nin the dressing can reduce overall battery longevity significantly.\\nAverage Time for Recharging\\nTo ensure the battery has been fully charged, the device should be connected to an A.C. supply for\\napproximately 3 hours. After approximately 2 hours of charging, the device will have achieved 80% of\\ntotal battery capacity.\\nLow Battery Alarm\\nWhile running on battery, a low-battery alarm will activate when remaining capacity of the battery is less\\nthan 20% (See “Alarm Operation”). Typically, the unit will continue to operate between 30 minutes and\\n1 hour after the low-battery alarm is activated.\\nLow Battery Shutoff\\nIf the battery charge falls below a functional level, the device will shutoff automatically and therapy will be\\ndiscontinued. At this point, the device must be plugged into an A.C. power source for therapy to resume.\\nOnce the A.C. Adapter is plugged in, pressing the ON button will restart the device.\\nRecharging the Battery\\nPlug the power cord from the A.C. Adapter into the power receptacle on the side of the therapy unit.\\nPlug the A.C. Adapter into a suitable 120 VAC, 60 Hz wall outlet.\\nWhen the device is connected to an AC power source, the green “power” LED on the front of the device\\nwill illuminate indicating AC power is present and the amber “charging” LED, located just below the\\n“power” LED, will illuminate when the battery is charging.\\nOnce the battery is fully charged, the amber LED will extinguish indicating the charge cycle is complete.\\nWhen the Curato™ Wound Treatment System is disconnected from the AC power source, the device\\nwill automatically switch over to the internal battery and continue to operate without interruption.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                                                  16\\nAlarm Operation\\nClearing an Alarm Condition\\nTo clear an alarm condition, turn the therapy unit OFF then ON.

Introduction\\nIndications\\nThe Curato™ Wound Treatment System is indicated for the application of suction  to\\nwounds to promote wound healing and for the removal of fluids, including wound exudates, irrigation\\nfluids, body fluids and infectious materials.\\nContraindications\\nThe Curato™ Wound Treatment System is contraindicated for patients with malignancy in the wound,\\nuntreated osteomyelIitis, non-enteric and unexplored fistulas, or necrotic tissue with eschar present. Do\\nnot place the foam dressing over exposed blood vessels or organs.\\nPrecautions\\nPrecautions should be taken for patients with active bleeding, difficult wound hemostasis, or who are on\\nanticoagulants. When placing the foam dressing in close proximity to blood vessels or organs, take\\ncare to ensure that they are adequately protected with overlying fascia, tissue or other protective\\nbarriers. Exposed tendon, nerves or blood vessels should be protected by moving available muscle or\\nfascia over them or by a layer of synthetic material. Greater care should be taken with respect to\\nweakened, irradiated or sutured blood vessels or organs. Bone fragments or sharp edges could puncture\\na dressing barrier, vessel or organ. Wounds with enteric fistula require special precautions in order to\\noptimize therapy.\\nAdditional Precautions\\n   Defibrillation: Remove the dressing if defibrillation is required in the area of dressing placement.\\n   Failure to remove the dressing may inhibit electrical current transmission and/or patient resuscitation.\\n   Magnetic Resonance Imaging : The Curato™ Suction Pump Unit is not MRI-compatible. Do not\\n   take into the MRI area.\\n   Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy : NEVER allow a device—whether on or off—inside a\\n   hyperbaric chamber. The device must be disconnected from the patient prior to HBO treatment.\\n   Large Canisters: Use of Large Canisters  may increase serious risks associated with excessive\\n   fluid loss. Monitor patient status continually. DO NOT USE for patients with low fluid volume, nor for patients\\n   at high risk of major hemorrhage.\\n   During Negative Pressure Therapy, the Curato™ Suction Pump and dressing are a closed system\\n   and are NOT vented to atmosphere.\\n   During Therapy, when a canister fills with fluid, it should be replaced immediately as fluids such as\\n   wound exudate will not be removed from the dressing once the canister is full.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                              2\\nSafety Tips\\nThe Curato™ Wound Treatment System is indicated for the application of suction  to\\nwounds to promote wound healing and for the removal of fluids, including wound exudates, irrigation\\nfluids, body fluids and infectious materials.\\nKEEP THERAPY ON\\nThe Curato™ Wound Treatment System should be operated at least 22 hours out of every 24 hour\\nperiod. Remove the foam dressing if therapy is terminated or is off for more than 2 hours in a 24 hour\\nperiod.\\nDRESSING CHANGES\\nClean the wound per veterinarian order prior to dressing application. Routine dressing changes should\\noccur every 48 to 72 hours. Dressing changes for infected wounds should be accomplished more\\nfrequently than 48 to 72 hours. Always replace with sterile disposables from unopened packages. Follow\\nestablished institution protocols regarding clean versus sterile technique.\\nMONITORING THE WOUND\\nInspect the dressing frequently to ensure that the foam is collapsed and that therapy is being delivered\\nin a consistent manner. Monitor periwound tissue and exudate for signs of infection or other\\ncomplications.* Extra care and attention should be given if there are any signs of possible infection or\\nrelated complications. Infection can be serious. With or without the Curato™ Wound Treatment System,\\ninfection can lead to many adverse complications including pain, discomfort, fever, septic shock, and\\nvarious other complications. With signs of more serious complications of infection, discontinue the use of the Curato™\\nWound Treatment System until the serious infection is diagnosed and properly treated.\\nDISCOMFORT / ADHERENCE\\nIf patient appears uncomfortable during dressing change, consider pre-medication, such as use of a\\nnon-adherent prior to foam placement or irrigation of a topical anesthetic agent such as 1% Lidocaine\\nprior to dressing removal.\\nUNSTABLE STRUCTURES\\nUse the lowest pressure setting on the Curato™ Wound Treatment System over unstable body\\nstructures such as unstable chest wall or non-intact fascia.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                              3\\nBODY CAVITY WOUNDS\\nUnderlying structures must be covered by natural tissues or synthetic materials that form a complete\\nbarrier between the underlying structures and the dressing.\\nINFINITI MEDICAL DRESSING USE\\nThe dressings are to be used exclusively with the Curato™ Wound Treatment System.\\nNOTE: All dressing components of the Curato™ Wound Treatment System are packaged sterile. The decision\\nto use clean versus sterile/aseptic technique is dependent upon wound pathophysiology and\\nclinician preference. All components of the Curato™ Wound Treatment System disposable set are\\nlatex free.\\nBe sure to comply with all other CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS for the Curato™ Wound\\nTreatment System.\\n*Signs of possible infection may include fever, tenderness, redness, swelling, increased warmth in the\\n                                                                                  \\t\\r \\xa0\\n wound area, purulent discharge or a strong odor. Vomiting, diarrhea, high fever, refractory hypotension,\\n may be added signs of more serious complications of infection.\\nWARNING: Do not pack the foam dressings into any areas of the wound.

Verify the dressing application is correct, the tubing is connected, and the suction tubing with\\nSlickConnect™ clamp is open.\\n2. Place the therapy unit in an upright position as level with the wound as possible. The device can be\\nplaced on a table, or attached to an I.V. pole using the I.V. Pole adapter.\\nCAUTION: The I.V. pole clamp should only be used on poles that are in excess of 0.9” \\ndiameter and are securely attached to a bed frame or suitable stand. To ensure stability of the\\ntherapy unit on the I.V. pole, it should be clamped no higher than two times the width of the pole\\nbase. The clamp should be tightened to ensure that the therapy unit cannot slide down the pole.\\n3. Press the ON button. All LED indicators will sequentially illuminate during the power-on self-test.\\n4. Each time the device is turned on, the front panel LED display will indicate the remaining therapy life\\nof the unit using the following display format: “d XX, h YY”. For example, if the display  indicates “d 11 h 22,” this means 11 days and 22 hours of therapy remain on the device. This\\ninformation can also be interpreted as the device has been used for 18 days and 2 hours.\\n5. Upon turning on the device, the dressing should slowly collapse indicating the presence of suction.\\nOnce dressing integrity is verified, adjust the unit for desired therapy. NOTE: The device must be\\nconnected to the A.C. Adapter while attempting to obtain an initial dressing seal.\\n6. Carefully check dressing for vacuum leaks, and repair with additional polyurethane drape, if\\nnecessary.\\n7. The Curato™ Wound Treatment System should be operated at least 22 hours out of every 24-hour\\nperiod. Remove the dressing if therapy is terminated or is off for more than 2 hours in a 24 hour\\nperiod.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                                14\\nTherapy Setting Adjustment\\nCAUTION: Only a veterinarian can prescribe the proper settings and protocols for the therapy unit.\\nFailure to follow product instructions or adjusting settings and performing therapy application\\nwithout the express direction and/or supervision of a veterinarian may lead to improper\\nproduct performance and the potential for serious or fatal injury.\\nNegative Pressure Level Adjustment\\nThere are five negative pressure settings that can be selected: -50 mmHg, -75 mmHg, -100 mmHg, -125\\nmmHg and -150 mmHg. The pressure selection buttons are located on the left side of the control panel.\\nThe         button decreases the negative pressure setting and the           button increases the negative\\npressure setting.\\n1. When the unit is powered-up, the current setting is selected automatically .\\n2. To change the setting, simply press either the          therapy selection button or      therapy selection\\n    button until desired therapy selection is indicated by the green LED.\\n3. The green LED indicator will flash indicating the selection has been made and will continue flashing\\nuntil the desired negative pressure level has been achieved at which time the LED will remain\\nilluminated. If the green LED indicator begins to flash during therapy, it means the device is unable to\\nmaintain the therapeutic setting. This event would most likely be associated with a dressing leak and\\nwill require clinician intervention to correct.\\nIntermittent Mode ON/OFF\\nThe Curato™ can operate in an intermittent suction mode with a 5 minute “ON” and 2 minute “OFF”\\ncycle. Press the       button to turn the Intermittent Mode on and off.\\nDuring intermittent operation, Curato™ will provide target therapy pressure during the “ON” part of the\\ncycle and approximately -25 mmHg during the “off” part of the cycle. By maintaining this lower pressure\\nwhile the unit is “OFF,” the dressing seal is never compromised. This method of applying intermittent\\npressure also increases patient comfort.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                                  15\\nBeeper Volume Adjustment\\nThe volume of the beeper can be adjusted to fit various care settings or patient preferences. To adjust\\nthe beeper volume, press and hold the ON button while simultaneously pressing the                    button to\\nincrease the volume, or the        button to decrease the volume. The LED display will indicate the volume\\nlevel.\\nBattery Operation\\nNOTE: The Curato™ Wound Treatment System is designed to permit use of the product while the internal\\nbattery is charging. The therapy unit will continue to operate properly while the battery is charging.\\nBattery Life\\nThe specified battery life of the Curato™ Wound Treatment System with a fully-charged battery and a\\nwell-sealed dressing is up to 24 hours. The actual life is dependent on the integrity of the dressing. A leak\\nin the dressing can reduce overall battery longevity significantly.\\nAverage Time for Recharging\\nTo ensure the battery has been fully charged, the device should be connected to an A.C. supply for\\napproximately 3 hours. After approximately 2 hours of charging, the device will have achieved 80% of\\ntotal battery capacity.\\nLow Battery Alarm\\nWhile running on battery, a low-battery alarm will activate when remaining capacity of the battery is less\\nthan 20% . Typically, the unit will continue to operate between 30 minutes and\\n1 hour after the low-battery alarm is activated.\\nLow Battery Shutoff\\nIf the battery charge falls below a functional level, the device will shutoff automatically and therapy will be\\ndiscontinued. At this point, the device must be plugged into an A.C. power source for therapy to resume.\\nOnce the A.C. Adapter is plugged in, pressing the ON button will restart the device.\\nRecharging the Battery\\nPlug the power cord from the A.C. Adapter into the power receptacle on the side of the therapy unit.\\nPlug the A.C. Adapter into a suitable 120 VAC, 60 Hz wall outlet.\\nWhen the device is connected to an AC power source, the green “power” LED on the front of the device\\nwill illuminate indicating AC power is present and the amber “charging” LED, located just below the\\n“power” LED, will illuminate when the battery is charging.\\nOnce the battery is fully charged, the amber LED will extinguish indicating the charge cycle is complete.\\nWhen the Curato™ Wound Treatment System is disconnected from the AC power source, the device\\nwill automatically switch over to the internal battery and continue to operate without interruption.\\n\\n\\nCurato™ System User’s Manual                                                                                                  16\\nAlarm Operation\\nClearing an Alarm Condition\\nTo clear an alarm condition, turn the therapy unit OFF then ON.
